Final Summary:  I have put the sample somalier.html and ancestry files in the shared drive.  The tool does not seem to resolve the ancestry and relatedness, but that is not surprising, because the genome sketch is based on the 1000 genomes project.

A possible resolution could be achieved by using a genome sketch based on cell lines.  So finding the normal samples and using the instructions from the somalier github to generate the sketches as well as a set of labels for the cells associated with each sketch. (edited) 

There are data sets that can be used to generate these genome sketches (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/studies/EGAS00001000610 and https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3080 - not sure if this one contains our cells). (edited) 

Or, another option to test this method is to use another data set that would align to the 1000 genomes genome sketch.  I looked around but did not want to use any controlled data sets for this project because we are putting it out on github.  One intriguing option was to test the tool using files from the Personal Genome Project, but that would not be disease-related.

I have also put the notebook in our shared DNA Nexus space.  It is very rough, but it has instructions on how to pull all the files needed to do the analysis so far.  It is relevant to DNAnexus commands on the command line so it would have to be altered to be used on other platforms.
