To address this problem, we have developed a new suicide plasmid, pHoss1, by using the pMAD plasmid backbone and anhydrotetracycline selection marker (secY antisense RNA) driven by an inducible Pxyl/tetO promoter. Expression of the secY antisense RNA eliminates merodiploids and selects for the loss of plasmid via a second allelic exchange, which enriches the number of mutants with deleted genes. To assess the effectiveness of pHoss1 for the generation of stable in-frame deletion mutations, we deleted the ispG and ispH genes of L. monocytogenes serotype 4b strain F2365. Results showed that identification of the second allelic exchange mutants was very efficient with 80\textendash 100\% of the colonies yielding desired deletion mutants. L. monocytogenes' intestinal cell attachment was not altered when ispG and ispH genes were deleted.

Combined with 3-d reconstruction, it has become an important tool for structural molecular biology. Larger objects such as cells and tissues cannot generally be squeezed in a thin enough film. Cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous sections (CEMOVIS) provides then a solution. It requires vitrification of a sizable piece of biological material and cutting it into ultrathin sections, which are observed in the vitrified state. Each of these operations raises serious difficulties that have now been overcome. In general, the native state seen with CEMOVIS is very different from what has been seen before and it is seen in more detail. CEMOVIS will give its full potential when combined with computerized electron tomography for 3-d reconstruction.},

They can be differentiated into four types depending on their ability to revert to the parental, cell-walled form and to the extent of their cell-wall modification. L-forms are significant in modern science because of their contributions to an improved understanding of principal questions and their interactions with eukaryotes. This review particularly focuses on research using stable protoplast-type L-forms which have contributed to a better understanding of the structural and functional organisation of the cytoplasmic membrane and of cell division. These L-forms, which have only a single surrounding bilayer membrane, also represent a unique expression system for production of recombinant proteins. A large proportion of L-form publications concern their putative role in human disease and its therapy, a topic which is discussed briefly. L-forms have also been used to form intracellular associations with plant cells and have been shown to elicit induced disease resistance offering a novel method for plant protection. The recent decline in active research on L-forms is a concern as knowledge and experience, as well as unique L-form strains which have been maintained for decades, are being lost.},

These results strongly suggest that propagation of 3A-type L forms does not proceed through intermediate formation of a 3B-type L body.

After in situ hybridization to whole cells of the six sequenced strains, epifluorescence microscopy confirmed probe specificity. The four probes were then used to make presumptive species and subspecies assignments of eight additional Fibrobacter strains not previously characterized by comparative sequencing. These assignments were confirmed by comparative sequencing of the 16S rRNA target regions from the additional organisms. Single-mismatch discrimination between certain probe and nontarget sequences was demonstrated, and fluorescent intensity was shown to be enhanced by hybridization to multiple probes of the same specificity.

Based on the patchy conservation of rRNA, oligonucleotide probes can be designed with specificities that range from the species level to the level of phyla or even domains. When these probes are labelled with fluorescent dyes or the enzyme horseradish peroxidase, they can be used to identify single microbial cells directly by fluorescence in situ hybridization. In this Review, we provide an update on the recent methodological improvements that have allowed more reliable quantification of microbial populations in situ in complex environmental samples, with a particular focus on the usefulness of group-specific probes in this era of ever-growing rRNA databases.},

  abstract = {Background Various fixation and permeabilization techniques have been developed for detection of intracellular antigens by flow cytometry; however, there are few studies using flow cytometry to detect the frequency of intracellular nucleic acids, particularly RNA. We tested six different permeabilization methods in order to gain access to a high quality method with minimal damage to intracellular components focusing on 18S rRNA in HeLa cells. Methods HeLa cells were fixed in 2\% paraformaldehyde. A variety of detergents and enzymes including saponin, TritonX-100, Tween-20, NP40, Proteinase K, and streptolysin O were used to optimize a protocol of permeabilization for the flow cytometric enumeration of intracellular 18S rRNA. Treated cells were subjected to standard protocol of flow cytometric in situ hybridization in the presence of FITC-labeled sense and antisense probes to detect 18S ribosomal RNAs. Samples were then analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer. To evaluate cell morphology, following hybridization the cells were fixed on glass slide, covered with DAPI, and evaluated on a fluorescent microscope with appropriate filter sets. Results In comparison with other methods, maximum cell frequency in percentage and fluorescent intensity (M1 = 2.1\%, M2 = 97.9\%) were obtained when the cells were treated with 0.2\% Tween-20 and incubated for 30 min (p = 0.001). Conclusion Our study indicated that the highest levels of mean fluorescence could be obtained when the cells were treated with Tween-20. However, it should be taken into consideration that for a successful flow cytometric result, other interfering factors such as hybridization conditions should also be optimized.},

Studying localization and dynamics of RNA in vitro or in cells requires tagging with suitable reporter molecules\textemdash fluorophores being the most prominent ones. Enzymatic RNA labeling approaches are currently emerging as valuable alternatives to purely chemical synthesis and to binding- or hybridization-based RNA-imaging approaches. Different classes of enzymes allow for cotranscriptional or posttranscriptional installation of small functional groups in RNA. The enzymatic step is typically combined with a second chemical step, providing flexibility regarding the reporter. The flourishing field of bioorthogonal chemistry propels this approach. We will present latest achievements and remaining challenges in the field of enzyme-mediated RNA tagging and emphasize efforts to achieve site-specificity and intracellular labeling.},

In the presence of low concentrations of bleach, the secondary structure of RNA is denatured and potential contaminating RNases are destroyed. Because of this, the `bleach gel' is a functional approach that addresses the need for an inexpensive and safe way to evaluate RNA integrity and will improve the ability of researchers to rapidly analyze RNA quality.},

At high concentrations, antibiotics exhibit antimicrobial activities on susceptible cells, while subinhibitory concentrations induce diverse biological responses in bacteria. At non-lethal concentrations, bacteria may sense antibiotics as extracellular chemicals to trigger different cellular responses, which may include an altered antibiotic resistance/tolerance profile. In natural settings, microbes are typically in polymicrobial communities and antibiotic-mediated interactions between species may play a significant role in bacterial community structure and function. However, these aspects have not yet fully been explored at the community level. Here we discuss the different types of interactions mediated by antibiotics and non-antibiotic metabolites as a function of their concentrations and speculate on how these may amplify the overall antibiotic resistance/tolerance and the spread of antibiotic resistance determinants in a context of polymicrobial community.},

Until recently, vaccines and adoptive cell therapies have been designed to target public tumor antigens common to multiple patients rather than private antigens specific to a single patient. Due to the difficulty of identifying public antigens that are expressed exclusively on tumor cells, these studies have yielded both clinical successes and serious immune-related adverse events. Multiple avenues of research now underscore the centrality of tumor-specific mutated private antigens to endogenous anti-tumor immunity. Immunotherapies that target these neoantigens may enable safer and more durable tumor regression, but personalized targeting presents a number of challenges. Foremost among these is to develop processes that accelerate advancement from neoantigen discovery to use of these neoantigens as vaccines or as targets for adoptive cell therapies. Exome sequencing has facilitated discovery of neoantigens for melanoma and other highly mutated cancers. New technologies \textendash{} possibly proceeding from T cell receptor repertoire sequencing \textendash{} are needed to identify antigens for cancers with low mutational burden and few neoantigens. In this review, we discuss progress toward personalizing T cell-mediated immunotherapy for cancer as well as challenges going forward.},

  abstract = {Bacterial infections trigger the expression of type I and II interferon genes but little is known about their effect on type III interferon (IFN-{$\lambda$}) genes, whose products play important roles in epithelial innate immunity against viruses. Here, we studied the expression of IFN-{$\lambda$} genes in cultured human epithelial cells infected with different pathogenic bacteria and in the mouse placenta infected with Listeria monocytogenes. We first showed that in intestinal LoVo cells, induction of IFN-{$\lambda$} genes by L. monocytogenes required bacterial entry and increased further during the bacterial intracellular phase of infection. Other Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis, also induced IFN-{$\lambda$} genes when internalized by LoVo cells. In contrast, Gram-negative bacteria Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Shigella flexneri and Chlamydia trachomatis did not substantially induce IFN-{$\lambda$}. We also found that IFN-{$\lambda$} genes were up-regulated in A549 lung epithelial cells infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and in HepG2 hepatocytes and BeWo trophoblastic cells infected with L. monocytogenes. In a humanized mouse line permissive to fetoplacental listeriosis, IFN-{$\lambda$}2/{$\lambda$}3 mRNA levels were enhanced in placentas infected with L. monocytogenes. In addition, the feto-placental tissue was responsive to IFN-{$\lambda$}2. Together, these results suggest that IFN-{$\lambda$} may be an important modulator of the immune response to Gram-positive intracellular bacteria in epithelial tissues.},

This abundance likely reflects the ability of this bacterium to survive in diverse environments, including soil, food, and the human host. This review focuses on the various mechanisms by which listerial proteins are attached at the bacterial surface and their many functions, including peptidoglycan metabolism, protein processing, adhesion to host cells, and invasion of host tissues. Extensive in silico analysis of the domains or motifs present in these mosaic proteins reveals that diverse structural features allow the surface proteome to interact with diverse bacterial or host components. This diversity offers new clues about the molecular bases of Listeria pathogenesis.},

  abstract = {Coordinating cell wall synthesis and cell division Most bacteria are protected by peptidoglycan cell walls, which must be remodeled to split the cell. Cell division requires the tubulin homolog FtsZ, a highly conserved cytoskeletal polymer that specifies the future site of division. Bisson-Filho et al. and Yang et al. found that the dynamic treadmilling of FtsZ filaments controls both the location and activity of the associated cell wall synthetic enzymes. This creates discrete sites of cell wall synthesis that circle around the division plane to divide the cell. Science, this issue p. 739, p. 744 The mechanism by which bacteria divide is not well understood. Cell division is mediated by filaments of FtsZ and FtsA (FtsAZ) that recruit septal peptidoglycan-synthesizing enzymes to the division site. To understand how these components coordinate to divide cells, we visualized their movements relative to the dynamics of cell wall synthesis during cytokinesis. We found that the division septum was built at discrete sites that moved around the division plane. FtsAZ filaments treadmilled circumferentially around the division ring and drove the motions of the peptidoglycan-synthesizing enzymes. The FtsZ treadmilling rate controlled both the rate of peptidoglycan synthesis and cell division. Thus, FtsZ treadmilling guides the progressive insertion of new cell wall by building increasingly smaller concentric rings of peptidoglycan to divide the cell. Bacterial cytokinesis is controlled by the circumferential treadmilling of FtsZ and FtsA filaments that drives the insertion of new cell wall. Bacterial cytokinesis is controlled by the circumferential treadmilling of FtsZ and FtsA filaments that drives the insertion of new cell wall.},

They possess MurNAc-6-phosphate (MurNAc-6P) etherase (MurQ in E. coli) enzymes, which are responsible for the intracellular conversion of MurNAc-6P to N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate and d-lactate. By applying mass spectrometry, we observed accumulation of MurNAc-6P in MurNAc-6P etherase deletion mutants but not in either the isogenic parental strains or complemented strains, suggesting that MurQ orthologs are required for the recycling of cell wall-derived MurNAc in these bacteria. Quantification of MurNAc-6P in {$\Delta$}murQ cells of S. aureus and B. subtilis revealed small amounts during exponential growth phase (0.19 nmol and 0.03 nmol, respectively, per ml of cells at an optical density at 600 nm [OD600] of 1) but large amounts during transition (0.56 nmol and 0.52 nmol) and stationary (0.53 nmol and 1.36 nmol) phases. The addition of MurNAc to {$\Delta$}murQ cultures greatly increased the levels of intracellular MurNAc-6P in all growth phases. The {$\Delta$}murQ mutants of S. aureus and B. subtilis showed no growth deficiency in rich medium compared to the growth of the respective parental strains, but intriguingly, they had a severe survival disadvantage in late stationary phase. Thus, although peptidoglycan recycling is apparently not essential for the growth of Gram-positive bacteria, it provides a benefit for long-term survival. IMPORTANCE The peptidoglycan of the bacterial cell wall is turned over steadily during growth. As peptidoglycan fragments were found in large amounts in spent medium of exponentially growing Gram-positive bacteria, their ability to recycle these fragments has been questioned. We conclusively showed recycling of the peptidoglycan component MurNAc in different Gram-positive model organisms and revealed that a MurNAc-6P etherase (MurQ or MurQ ortholog) enzyme is required in this process. We further demonstrated that recycling occurs predominantly during the transition to stationary phase in S. aureus and B. subtilis, explaining why peptidoglycan fragments are found in the medium during exponential growth. We quantified the intracellular accumulation of recycling products in MurNAc-6P etherase gene mutants, revealing that about 5\% and 10\% of the MurNAc of the cell wall per generation is recycled in S. aureus and B. subtilis, respectively. Importantly, we showed that MurNAc recycling and salvaging does not sustain growth in these bacteria but is used to enhance survival during late stationary phase.},

The specificity of the probes was evaluated using pure cultures as well as porcine tissue sections with artificial presence of mycoplasma, and the probes were found specific for the target organisms. The assay was applied on sections of 28 tissue samples from pigs infected with one or more of the three Mycoplasma species as determined by cultivation. M. hyopneumoniae and M. hyorhinis were identified in accordance with cultivation in lung sections from nine pigs affected by catarrhal to purulent bronchopneumonia. Likewise, in eight cases of fibrinous pericarditis, M. hyopneumoniae, M. hyorhinis and M. hyosynoviae were the infectious agents according to cultivation and were correctly identified by in situ hybridisation. Out of 11 joints cultivation positive for M. hyosynoviae, the probe was only able to identify M. hyosynoviae in eight cases probably due to a low number of microorganisms in the tissue sections. The in situ hybridisation assay is well suited for use in diagnostic and experimental work as well as a tool for pathogenesis studies.},

Bacterial membrane vesicles were discovered over 60 years ago and have been extensively studied in Gram-negative bacteria. During their production, EVs are loaded with proteins, nucleic acids, and various compounds that are subsequently released into the environment. Depending on the packaged cargo, EVs have a broad spectrum of action and are involved in pathogenesis, antibiotic resistance, nutrient uptake, and nucleic acid transfer. Due to differences in cell wall structure, EVs in Gram-positive bacteria have been disregarded for decades, and our understanding of their biogenesis and host cell interaction is incomplete. Recently, studies on bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp., Bacillus subtilis, and Mycobacterium spp. have demonstrated EV production in Gram-positive bacteria and shown the great importance EVs have in Gram-positive bacterial physiology and disease progression. Here, we review the latest findings on the biogenesis and functions of EVs from Gram-positive bacteria and identify key areas for future research.},

Heterogeneity appears now as an intrinsic and multi-origin feature of microbial populations and is a major determinant of their beneficial or detrimental functional properties. The understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms behind the behavior of bacteria in microbial communities requires therefore observations at the single-cell level in order to overcome ``averaging'' effects inherent to traditional global approaches. Recent advances in the development of fluorescence-based approaches dedicated to single-cell analysis provide the opportunity to study microbial communities with an unprecedented level of resolution and to obtain detailed insights on the cell structure, metabolism activity, multicellular behavior and bacterial interactions in complex communities. These methods are now increasingly applied in the field of food microbiology in different areas ranging from research laboratories to industry.

To study such hypothetical protocells, giant vesicles are being widely used as a simple model. Lipid vesicles can undergo complex morphological changes enabling self-reproduction such as growth, fission, and extra- and intravesicular budding. These properties of vesicular systems may in some way reflect the mechanism of reproduction used by protocells. Moreover, remarkable similarities exist between the morphological changes observed in giant vesicles and bacterial L-form cells, which represent bacteria that have lost their rigid cell wall, but retain the ability to reproduce. L-forms feature a dismantled cellular structure and are unable to carry out classical binary fission. We propose that the striking similarities in morphological transitions of L-forms and giant lipid vesicles may provide insights into primitive reproductive mechanisms and contribute to a better understanding of the origin and evolution of mechanisms of cell reproduction.},

  abstract = {Cell wall-deficient bacteria, or L-forms, represent an extreme example of bacterial plasticity. Stable L-forms can multiply and propagate indefinitely in the absence of a cell wall. Data presented here are consistent with the model that intracellular vesicles in Listeria monocytogenes L-form cells represent the actual viable reproductive elements. First, small intracellular vesicles are formed along the mother cell cytoplasmic membrane, originating from local phospholipid accumulation. During growth, daughter vesicles incorporate a small volume of the cellular cytoplasm, and accumulate within volume-expanding mother cells. Confocal Raman microspectroscopy demonstrated the presence of nucleic acids and proteins in all intracellular vesicles, but only a fraction of which reveals metabolic activity. Following collapse of the mother cell and release of the daughter vesicles, they can establish their own membrane potential required for respiratory and metabolic processes. Premature depolarization of the surrounding membrane promotes activation of daughter cell metabolism prior to release. Based on genome resequencing of L-forms and comparison to the parental strain, we found no evidence for predisposing mutations that might be required for L-form transition. Further investigations revealed that propagation by intracellular budding not only occurs in Listeria species, but also in L-form cells generated from different Enterococcus species. From a more general viewpoint, this type of multiplication mechanism seems reminiscent of the physicochemical selfreproducing properties of abiotic lipid vesicles used to study the primordial reproduction pathways of putative prokaryotic precursor cells.},

Advances in sequencing technologies have made it feasible to capture whole-genome sequence variation for each sample under study, providing the potential to detect all changes at all positions in the genome from single nucleotide changes to large-scale insertions and deletions. In this review, we focus on recent work that has applied this powerful new approach and summarize some of the advances that this has brought in our understanding of the details of how bacterial pathogens evolve.},

  title = {Lysozyme Resistance of {{Listeria}} Monocytogenes},
  author = {Burke II, Thomas Patrick},
  year = {2015},
  abstract = {Bacterial pathogens must survive exposure to antibacterial molecules of the innate immune system in order to successfully establish infection. Such is the case with Listeria monocytogenes, a Gram-positive bacterial pathogen that is the causative agent of listeriosis, a deadly foodborne disease dangerous to pregnant women and immunocompromised individuals. L. monocytogenes is highly resistant to antibacterial molecules of the innate immune system such as lysozyme, a potent cell wall-degrading enzyme found throughout the body of all animals. Nearly 100 years ago, Alexander Fleming discovered lysozyme and observed that pathogenic bacteria were lysozyme-resistant, while non-pathogens were lysozyme-sensitive. Curiously, nonpathogenic lysozyme-sensitive bacteria encode the same cell wall enzymes as pathogenic lysozyme-resistant bacteria. It therefore remained unclear what distinguished pathogens from non-pathogens in regards to lysozyme resistance. In this work, a forward genetic screen was performed to identify additional factors required for lysozyme resistance in L. monocytogenes and subsequent investigations were made to uncover how these molecules regulated one another. The screen for lysozyme-sensitive mutants identified a number of cell wall-related enzymes, such as the peptidoglycan deacetylase pgdA; however no enzymes were identified that were unique to L. monocytogenes. Rather, the screen identified two regulators of gene expression, the non-coding RNA Rli31 and the transcription factor DegU, which upregulated expression of cell wall-modifying enzymes. Mutants of rli31 and degU were similarly sensitive to lysozyme as mutants of pgdA, suggesting that the regulators were absolutely required for lysozyme resistance. These data suggested that high lysozyme resistance of L. monocytogenes was not due to the acquisition of novel cell wall-modifying enzymes, but was due to upregulation of cell wall enzymes that were distributed among both pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria. This logic provides an alternative example of how virulence phenotypes are acquired by bacteria, many of which originate via horizontal gene transfer. We propose that pathogen-specific regulation of broadly distributed genes represents another mechanism by which pathogens acquire virulence. Non-coding RNAs are an increasingly appreciated class of gene regulators in bacteria, with over 200 non-coding RNAs having been identified to date in L. monocytogenes. The mechanism of Rli31 function was investigated and multiple lines of evidence suggested that the  2 uncharacterized protein SpoVG was as an intimately related, opposing regulator to Rli31. Neither Rli31 nor SpoVG was epistatic with any of the fourteen lysozyme-sensitive mutants, and the data suggested that Rli31 and SpoVG both regulated an unknown lysozyme-resistance gene. The cell wall morphology of the spoVG mutant suggested that this unknown gene may be required for producing extracellular polysaccharide. Separately from the lysozyme-resistance phenotypes of these mutants, Rli31 inhibited expression of the carbohydrate import protein Lmo0901, while SpoVG was independently required for Lmo0901 expression. The 5' UTR of SpoVG contained 14/14 nucleotides of perfect complementarity to Rli31, yet Rli31 did not regulate SpoVG mRNA nor protein abundance. This suggested that the SpoVG mRNA may function as an Rli31 decoy target that regulates its activity. In summary, these data described a complex model whereby Rli31 and SpoVG independently and oppositely regulate multiple target genes, but may also regulate one another. Attempts were made to better characterize SpoVG, whose function remained unclear. SpoVG was required for swarming motility of L. monocytogenes, and suppressor mutations of this phenotype mapped to RNAse J1, Rho, and NusG. SpoVG was then described as an RNAbinding protein that interacted with multiple sRNAs in vitro but did not bind RNAs with known protein-binding partners such as SRP RNA. Together, these results suggested that SpoVG is a pleiotropic RNA-binding protein that interacts closely with sRNAs, and we propose that SpoVG is similar in function to the well-described RNA chaperone Hfq in Gram-negative bacteria. In conclusion, this study described the genes required for lysozyme resistance of L. monocytogenes, and identified a complex regulatory mechanism required for their expression. From these data, we determined that high lysozyme resistance in pathogens is due to upregulation of common cell wall enzymes. We conclude that the non-coding RNA Rli31 and the RNA binding protein SpoVG are important regulators of lysozyme resistance genes in L. monocytogenes. Together, this study provides a comprehensive examination of lysozyme resistance genes in a bacterial pathogen.},

  abstract = {The Gram-positive bacterium Listeria monocytogenes is a facultative intracellular pathogen that relies on the regulated secretion and activity of a variety of proteins that sustain life within diverse environments. PrsA2 has recently been identified as a secreted peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase and chaperone that is dispensable for bacterial growth in broth culture but essential for L. monocytogenes virulence. Following host infection, PrsA2 contributes to the proper folding and activity of secreted proteins that are required for bacterial replication within the host cytosol and for bacterial spread to adjacent cells. PrsA2 is one member of a family of Gram-positive secretion chaperones that appear to play important roles in bacterial physiology; however, it is not known how these proteins recognize their substrate proteins or the degree to which their function is conserved across diverse Gram-positive species. We therefore examined PrsA proteins encoded by a variety of Gram-positive bacteria for functional complementation of L. monocytogenes mutants lacking prsA2. PrsA homologues encoded by Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Lactococcus lactis were examined for functional complementation of a variety of L. monocytogenes PrsA2-associated phenotypes central to L. monocytogenes pathogenesis and bacterial cell physiology. Our results indicate that while selected aspects of PrsA2 function are broadly conserved among diverse Gram-positive bacteria, PrsA2 exhibits unique specificity for L. monocytogenes target proteins required for pathogenesis. The L. monocytogenes PrsA2 chaperone thus appears evolutionarily optimized for virulence factor secretion within the host cell cytosol while still maintaining aspects of activity relevant to more general features of Gram-positive protein translocation.},

A potent innate and adaptive immune response is required for containment and clearance of L. monocytogenes. However, some elements of this response, such as type 1 interferons, can be detrimental to the host. Recent studies have revealed novel functions for the complement system, an ancient arm of innate immunity, in this process.

The completion of each stage is dependent on the orchestrated activity of specialized bacterial factors, in turn tightly controlled by a specific set of regulators. Some virulence factors and modulators also assume an important role in bacterial resistance and evasion to host defense mechanisms. In the last years, the advent of genomics promoted an increasingly prolific identification and functional characterization of new Listeria virulence factors.

The derivatives (i) transpose at a significantly elevated frequency, (ii) generate transcriptional lacZ fusions when inserted into a chromosomal gene in the appropriate orientation, and (iii) allow the rapid cloning in Escherichia coli of chromosomal DNA flanking transposon insertions. The rapid cloning of DNA flanking insertions is possible because the transposon derivatives carry ColE1 replication functions, a cluster of polylinker cloning sites, and antibiotic resistance genes selectable in E. coli (bla in the case of Tn917-LTV1; neo and ble in the case of Tn917-LTV3). The enhanced transposition frequency of Tn917-LTV1 and Tn917-LTV3 (about 100-fold in Bacillus subtilis) is believed to be due to the fortuitous placement of vector-derived promoters upstream from the Tn917 transposase gene. In L. monocytogenes, Tn917-LTV3 transposed at a frequency of 8 x 10(-4) when introduced on a pE194Ts-derived vector and generated at least eight different auxotrophic mutations. Two nonhemolytic insertion mutants of L. monocytogenes were isolated, and DNA flanking the transposon insertions was cloned directly into E. coli, making use of the ColE1 rep functions and neo gene carried by Tn917-LTV3. Both insertions were shown to be within hlyA, the L. monocytogenes hemolysin structural gene. Although Tn917-LTV1 and Tn917-LTV3 were constructed specifically for genetic analysis of L. monocytogenes, their enhanced transposition frequency and convenience for cloning of DNA adjacent to sites of insertions make them the transposon derivatives of choice for insertional mutagenesis in any gram-positive bacteria that support replication of pE194Ts.},

It is also presumed to improve specimen preparation for electron microscopy and to reduce beam damage. Here we study the effect of trehalose on the preparation and observation by cryo-electron microscopy of thin vitrified films of biological suspensions. We observe that trehalose, as compared to sucrose, can indeed reduce electron beam damage to biological particles, as determined from the dose necessary for the onset of bubbling. Surprisingly, we also find that the contrast of biological particles is higher in a vitrified solution of trehalose than in one of sucrose. This effect can be explained if the water evaporation during the specimen preparation is less in the presence of trehalose than with sucrose, but we do not yet understand the underlying reasons since the evaporation properties of both sugars are similar at a macroscopic level. We conclude that trehalose is truly a remarkable substance and that more investigation is needed in order to fully understand its properties, and that the addition of ca. 3\textendash 5\% trehalose to biological suspensions is a simple and useful method to reduce commonly arising drying artefacts and water evaporation in the thin film vitrification method.},

The suitability of the 3-D aggregates as an infection model was examined by immunohistochemistry, adherence and invasion assays, scanning electron microscopy, and cytokine and mucoglycoprotein production. Immunohistochemical characterization of the 3-D A549 aggregates showed increased expression of epithelial cell-specific markers and decreased expression of cancer-specific markers compared to their monolayer counterparts. Immunohistochemistry of junctional markers on A549 3-D cells revealed that these cells formed tight junctions and polarity, in contrast to the cells grown as monolayers. Additionally, the 3-D aggregates stained positively for the production of mucoglycoprotein while the monolayers showed no indication of staining. Moreover, mucin-specific antibodies to MUC1 and MUC5A bound with greater affinity to 3-D aggregates than to the monolayers. P. aeruginosa attached to and penetrated A549 monolayers significantly more than the same cells grown as 3-D aggregates. Scanning electron microscopy of A549 cells grown as monolayers and 3-D aggregates infected with P. aeruginosa showed that monolayers detached from the surface of the culture plate postinfection, in contrast to the 3-D aggregates, which remained attached to the microcarrier beads. In response to infection, proinflammatory cytokine levels were elevated for the 3-D A549 aggregates compared to monolayer controls. These findings suggest that A549 lung cells grown as 3-D aggregates may represent a more physiologically relevant model to examine the interactions between P. aeruginosa and the lung epithelium during infection.},

  abstract = {Like many eukaryotes, bacteria make widespread use of postreplicative DNA methylation for the epigenetic control of DNA-protein interactions. Unlike eukaryotes, however, bacteria use DNA adenine methylation (rather than DNA cytosine methylation) as an epigenetic signal. DNA adenine methylation plays roles in the virulence of diverse pathogens of humans and livestock animals, including pathogenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Vibrio, Yersinia, Haemophilus, and Brucella. In Alphaproteobacteria, methylation of adenine at GANTC sites by the CcrM methylase regulates the cell cycle and couples gene transcription to DNA replication. In Gammaproteobacteria, adenine methylation at GATC sites by the Dam methylase provides signals for DNA replication, chromosome segregation, mismatch repair, packaging of bacteriophage genomes, transposase activity, and regulation of gene expression. Transcriptional repression by Dam methylation appears to be more common than transcriptional activation. Certain promoters are active only during the hemimethylation interval that follows DNA replication; repression is restored when the newly synthesized DNA strand is methylated. In the E. coli genome, however, methylation of specific GATC sites can be blocked by cognate DNA binding proteins. Blockage of GATC methylation beyond cell division permits transmission of DNA methylation patterns to daughter cells and can give rise to distinct epigenetic states, each propagated by a positive feedback loop. Switching between alternative DNA methylation patterns can split clonal bacterial populations into epigenetic lineages in a manner reminiscent of eukaryotic cell differentiation. Inheritance of self-propagating DNA methylation patterns governs phase variation in the E. coli pap operon, the agn43 gene, and other loci encoding virulence-related cell surface functions.},

In order to explore the role of the prfA gene product in the pathogenesis of listerial infection, we constructed a site-directed insertion mutation in prfA by the chromosomal integration of a novel suicide vector containing a portion of the prfA coding region. This mutation not only transcriptionally silenced the listeriolysin (lisA) gene but also abrogated production of specific RNA transcripts corresponding to the phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (pic) and metalloprotease (mpl) genes, two further virulence gene products expressed only by pathogenic Listeria strains. The strain was also found to be avirulent when tested in a mouse model of listerial infection. The concomitant loss of multiple characteristics such as production of LisA, Pic, Mpl, and loss of virulence in a mouse infection model is the result of a mutation in a single gene and demonstrates that the prfA gene product is a positive regulator of multiple virulence determinants in L. monocytogenes.},

Three model bacteria, i.e., Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Bacillus subtilis were applied to observe the above fixation methods for the morphology preservation of bacterial cells and surface ultrastructures. All the fixation methods could effectively preserve cell morphology. However, for preserving bacterial surface ultrastructures, the methods applying aldehyde fixations performed much better than those using alcohols, since the alcohols could detach the surface filaments (i.e., flagella and pili) significantly. Based on the quantitative and qualitative assessments, the 2.5\% glutaraldehyde was proposed as a promising fixation solution both for observing morphology of both bacterial cell and surface ultrastructures, while the methonal/acetone mixture was the worst fixation solution which may obtain unreliable results.},

Two-dimensional (2D) protein crystals to be analyzed by electron crystallography are best preserved by sugar embedding.

Sugars such as trehalose can also be added to negative staining solutions used to prepare proteins and macromolecular complexes for structural studies by single-particle electron microscopy (EM). In this review, we describe trehalose and its characteristics that make it so well suited for preparation of EM specimens and we review specimen preparation methods with a focus on the use of trehalose.},

Although it is an uncommon cause of infection in the population at large, L. monocytogenes is an important cause of central nervous system infection in those with impaired cell-mediated immunity, whether due to underlying disease or treatment with immunosuppressive therapeutic agents; it is the etiology in 20\% of bacterial meningitis cases in neonates and in 20\% of cases in those older than 50 years. Ampicillin is considered the treatment of choice, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is recommended for those allergic to penicillin.

Interestingly, c-di-AMP is essential for growth of Gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. Many studies demonstrated that perturbation of c-di-AMP metabolism affects the integrity of the bacterial cell envelope. Therefore, it has been assumed that the nucleotide is essential for proper cell envelope synthesis. In this Opinion paper, we propose that the cell envelope phenotypes caused by perturbations of c-di-AMP metabolism can be interpreted differently: c-di-AMP might indirectly control cell envelope integrity by modulating the turgor, a physical variable that needs to be tightly adjusted. We also discuss open questions related to c-di-AMP metabolism that need to be urgently addressed by future studies.},

  abstract = {A study has been made of the physical chemistry of the development of colonies on the surface of a minimal agar medium by a standard strain of Aerobacter (Klebsiella) aerogenes and by drug-resistant strains derived from it. Histograms of final colony diameter, constructed from measurements on plates having different numbers of colonies, have one maximum and are approximately symmetrical. Normal Gauss curves have been verified to fit some of the histograms, most of which are of similar form, although occasionally a somewhat wide spread on the side of increasing diameter occurred. When moderate or large numbers of colonies are present the total colony area supportable by the plate is proportional to the total capacity of the plate. The distribution of sizes, however, is shown to depend partly on the variation in the lags of the single cells inoculated and upon the free space left around the different individuals on the plates. A complex interplay of individual with cooperative or competitive factors thus exists. A detailed study has been made of the growth of single colonies. The initial exponential growth of the single cell is soon replaced by a phase in which the radius of the developing colony is linearly related to the time of incubation. In this phase diffusion of nutrients, buffer or waste products is not rate determining and the colonies remain more or less disk-shaped with a fairly regular perimeter. With moderate or large numbers of colonies exhaustion of the plate stops growth at this stage, but in the protracted growth which occurs when a few colonies only are present the 'radial law' phase gives way eventually to a slower phase in which the area of the colony increases linearly with time. Diffusion, chiefly affecting pH rather than nutrient supply, now becomes more and more the dominant factor controlling growth and the colony perimeter becomes increasingly irregular. Morphological changes may now appear. This is dealt with briefly as a prelude to a further paper. Kinetic models have been constructed for various aspects of the research and have been tested against the results.},

Indeed, the cell biology of the infectious process has been deciphered in great detail and provided insights in both the way bacterial pathogen manipulate the host and unsuspected functions of well-known cellular proteins. The intra- and intercellular motility has in particular been instrumental in understanding actin-based motility in general. The analysis of the two main Listeria invasion proteins and that of their host specificities have illustrated how in vitro studies can help generating or choosing relevant animal models for in vivo studies. Listeria post-genomics studies have highlighted the power of comparative genomics in virulence studies. Together, Listeria, after being recognized as a powerful tool in immunology, now appears as one of the most insightful models in infection biology.},

This bacterium invades and replicates in most cell types, due to its multiple strategies to exploit host molecular mechanisms. Research aiming at unravelling Listeria invasion and intracellular lifestyle has led to a number of key discoveries in infection biology, cell biology and also microbiology. In this review, we report on our most recent advances in understanding the intimate crosstalk between the bacterium and its host, resulting from in-depth studies performed over the past five years. We specifically highlight new concepts in RNA-based regulation in bacteria and discuss important findings in cell biology, including a new role for clathrin and an atypical mitochondrial fragmentation mechanism. We also illustrate the notion that bacterial infection regulates host gene expression at the chromatin level, contributing to an emerging field called patho-epigenetics.

Despite the common structure, each FP has unique properties. Thus, there is no single 'best' FP for every circumstance, and each FP has advantages and disadvantages. To guide decisions about which FP is right for a given application, we have quantitatively characterized the brightness, photostability, pH stability and monomeric properties of more than 40 FPs to enable straightforward and direct comparison between them.

We have previously shown that the Gram-negative pathogen Vibrio cholerae can tolerate exposure to the typically bactericidal {$\beta$}-lactam antibiotics by assuming a spherical morphotype devoid of detectable cell wall material. However, it is unclear how widespread {$\beta$}-lactam tolerance is. Here, we tested a panel of clinically significant Gram-negative pathogens for their response to the potent, broad-spectrum carbapenem antibiotic meropenem. We show that clinical isolates of Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella aerogenes, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, but not Escherichia coli, exhibited moderate to high levels of tolerance of meropenem, both in laboratory growth medium and in human serum. Importantly, tolerance was mediated by cell wall-deficient spheroplasts, which readily recovered wild-type morphology and growth upon removal of antibiotic. Our results suggest that carbapenem tolerance is prevalent in clinically significant bacterial species, and we suggest that this could contribute to treatment failure associated with these organisms.},

Over 700 recombinations were detected, with genes encoding major antigens frequently affected. Among these were ten capsule switching events, one of which accompanied a population shift as vaccine-escape serotype 19A isolates emerged in the USA following the introduction of the conjugate polysaccharide vaccine. The evolution of resistance to fluoroquinolones, rifampicin and macrolides was observed to occur on multiple occasions. This study details how genomic plasticity within lineages of recombinogenic bacteria can permit adaptation to clinical interventions over remarkably short timescales.},

  abstract = {Efferocytosis, the process by which dying or dead cells are removed by phagocytosis, has an important role in development, tissue homeostasis and innate immunity. Efferocytosis is mediated, in part, by receptors that bind to exofacial phosphatidylserine (PS) on cells or cellular debris after loss of plasma membrane asymmetry. Here we show that a bacterial pathogen, Listeria monocytogenes, can exploit efferocytosis to promote cell-to-cell spread during infection. These bacteria can escape the phagosome in host cells by using the pore-forming toxin listeriolysin O (LLO) and two phospholipase C enzymes. Expression of the cell surface protein ActA allows L. monocytogenes to activate host actin regulatory factors and undergo actin-based motility in the cytosol, eventually leading to formation of actin-rich protrusions at the cell surface. Here we show that protrusion formation is associated with plasma membrane damage due to LLO/'s pore-forming activity. LLO also promotes the release of bacteria-containing protrusions from the host cell, generating membrane-derived vesicles with exofacial PS. The PS-binding receptor TIM-4 (encoded by the Timd4 gene) contributes to efficient cell-to-cell spread by L. monocytogenes in macrophages in vitro and growth of these bacteria is impaired in Timd4-/- mice. Thus, L. monocytogenes promotes its dissemination in a host by exploiting efferocytosis. Our results indicate that PS-targeted therapeutics may be useful in the fight against infections by L. monocytogenes and other bacteria that use similar strategies of cell-to-cell spread during infection.},

The phenotype of mature tissue macrophages represents the composite of environmental and differentiation-dependent imprinting. Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD3) are stimuli commonly used to induce macrophage differentiation in monocytic cell lines but the extent of differentiation in comparison to primary tissue macrophages is unclear. We have compared the phenotype of the promonocytic THP-1 cell line after various protocols of differentiation utilising VD3 and PMA in comparison to primary human monocytes or monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). Both stimuli induced changes in cell morphology indicative of differentiation but neither showed differentiation comparable to MDM. In contrast, PMA treatment followed by 5 days resting in culture without PMA (PMAr) increased cytoplasmic to nuclear ratio, increased mitochondrial and lysosomal numbers and altered differentiation-dependent cell surface markers in a pattern similar to MDM. Moreover, PMAr cells showed relative resistance to apoptotic stimuli and maintained levels of the differentiation-dependent anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 similar to MDM. PMAr cells retained a high phagocytic capacity for latex beads, and expressed a cytokine profile that resembled MDM in response to TLR ligands, in particular with marked TLR2 responses. Moreover, both MDM and PMAr retained marked plasticity to stimulus-directed polarization. These findings suggest a modified PMA differentiation protocol can enhance macrophage differentiation of THP-1 cells and identify increased numbers of mitochondria and lysosomes, resistance to apoptosis and the potency of TLR2 responses as important discriminators of the level of macrophage differentiation for transformed cells.},

In such studies probe EUB338 (Amann et al., 1990) is routinely used to quantify members of the domain Bacteria with a sufficiently high cellular ribosome content. Recent reevaluations of probe EUB338 coverage based on all publicly available 16S rRNA sequences, however, indicated that important bacterial phyla, most notably the Planctomycetales and Verrucomicrobia, are missed by this probe. We therefore designed and evaluated two supplementary versions (EUB338-II and EUB338-III) of probe EUB338 for in situ detection of most of those phyla not detected with probe EUB338. In situ dissociation curves with target and non-target organisms were recorded under increasing stringency to optimize hybridization conditions. For that purpose a digital image software routine was developed. In situ hybridization of a complex biofilm community with the three EUB338 probes demonstrated the presence of significant numbers of probe EUB338-II and EUB338-III target organisms. The application of EUB338, EUB338-II and EUB338-III should allow a more accurate quantification of members of the domain Bacteria in future molecular ecological studies.},

  abstract = {Transition of bacteria to the L-form state is thought to play a possible role in immune evasion and bacterial persistence during treatment with cell wall-targeting antibiotics. However, isolation and handling of L-form bacteria is challenging, mainly due to their high sensitivity to changes in osmolarity. Here, we describe detailed protocols for the preparation of L-form medium, isolation of L-forms from urine using a filtration method, detection of L-forms in urine samples by phase contrast microscopy and induction of L-forms in vitro. The exact requirements for survival and growth of L-forms may vary from strain to strain. Therefore, the methods presented here are intended to act as basic guidelines for establishing L-form protocols within individual laboratories, rather than as precise instructions. The filtration method can lead to a reduction in the number of L-forms in a sample and should not be used for quantification. However, it is the only method used so far for effective separation of cell wall-deficient variants from their walled counterparts and for identification of bacterial strains, which are capable of Lform switching in patients with urinary tract infections. The filtration method has the potential to be adapted for the isolation of L-forms from patients with other categories of bacterial infections and from environmental samples.},

  abstract = {When the cell wall of Bacillus subtilis is removed by lysozyme and the resultant protoplasts are plated on hypertonic soft agar medium, each protoplast forms an L colony. L bodies from such L colonies again plate as L-colony-forming units (CFU). However, if protoplasts or L bodies are "conditioned" by 1 h of incubation in 0.4\% casein hydrolysate medium and then incubated in 25\% gelatin medium for 1 h, 60 to 100\% of the formerly naked cells give rist to bacillary colonies. The present experiments largely explain the mechanism responsible for the "heritable" persistence of the wall-less state in B. subtilis. It is shown that protoplasts produce a reversion inhibitory factor (RIF) which blocks reversion when the cell concentration exceeds 5 x 105 CFU/ml. This inhibitor is nondialyzable and sensitive to trypsin, heat, and detergent. Efficient reversion at 2 x 107 CFU/ml is obtained if the protoplasts are treated with trypsin after conditioning and chloramphenicol is incorporated into the gelatin reversion medium. In the presence of 500 mug of trypsin per ml, the requirement for gelatin is sharply reduced, and reversion occurs rapidly in liquid medium containing only 10\% gelatin. Trypsin also stimulates reversion in L colonies growing on soft agar. Latent RIF is activated by beta-mercaptoethanol. This reagent blocks reversion of protoplast suspensions at densities of 5 x 105 CFU/ml. Comparison of the autolytic behavior of B. subtilis and of the RIF revealed that several or the properties of the two activities coincide: both are inhibited by high concentrations of gelatin, both are activated by beta-mercaptoethanol, and both have high affinity for cell wall. Going on the assumption that RIF is autolysin, models for protoplast reversion is suggested by the finding that mutants with altered teichoic acid show altered reversion behavior.},

We have generated stable, non-reverting l-form variants of the Gram-positive pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, and studied the cellular and molecular changes associated with this transition. Stable l-form cells can occur as small protoplast-like vesicles and as multinucleated, large bodies. They have lost the thick, multilayered murein sacculus and are surrounded by a cytoplasmic membrane only, although peptidoglycan precursors are still produced. While they lack murein-associated molecules including Internalin A, membrane-anchored proteins such as Internalin B are retained. Surprisingly, l-forms were found to be able to divide and propagate indefinitely without a wall. Time-lapse microscopy of fluorescently labelled l-forms indicated a switch to a novel form of cell division, where genome-containing membrane vesicles are first formed within enlarged l-forms, and subsequently released by collapse of the mother cell. Array-based transcriptomics of parent and l-form cells revealed manifold differences in expression of genes associated with morphological and physiological functions. The l-forms feature downregulated metabolic functions correlating with the dramatic shift in surface to volume ratio, whereas upregulation of stress genes reflects the difficulties in adapting to this unusual, cell wall-deficient lifestyle.},

In recent years, our knowledge of the mechanisms of RNA degradation has increased considerably with discovery of the participating RNases and analysis of mutants affected in the various degradative pathways. Among these processes, mRNA decay and stable RNA degradation generally have been considered distinct, and also separate from RNA maturation. In this review, each of these processes is described, as it is currently understood in bacteria. The picture that emerges is that decay of mRNA and degradation of stable RNA share many common features, and that their initial steps also overlap with those of RNA maturation. Thus, bacterial cells do not contain dedicated machinery for degradation of different classes of RNA or for different processes. Rather, only the specificity of the RNase and the accessibility of the substrate determine whether or not a particular RNA will be acted upon.},

  abstract = {Listeria monocytogenes is an intracellular ubiquitous organism that affects patients with decreased cell mediated immunity. Listeria causes the most severe disease in patients who have HIV infection, cancer, diabetes mellitus, renal failure, alcoholism and who are pregnant. Listeria monocytogenes is a short, gram-positive rod that can occur singly or in short chains. The organism grows well at refrigerator temperatures (5\textendash 10 C) and is a known food-borne pathogen. Listeria monocytogenes has been known as a veterinary disease that causes a basilar meningitis (circling disease) in herd animals. The bacterium has been found in 5\textendash 15\% of normal stool samples. Listeria has also been recovered from a variety of foods including soft cheeses, raw milk, and processed meats. There are close to 2,000 cases of listeriosis which account for approximately 425 deaths each year. The infection usually occurs after ingestion of infected food products. The incubation period is between two and six weeks. Iron supplementation has been found to promote disease and gastric acid has shown protective effects. The clinical manifestations include sepsis, meningitis, rhomboencephalitis, brain abscess, endocarditis, acute gastrointestinal illness and a variety of focal infections. There are also many unique complications of pregnancy including preterm labor, chorioamnionitis, spontaneous abortion, and stillbirth. Listeria crosses the placenta and causes early and late onset disease in the neonate, with the most severe manifestation being granulomatosis infantiseptica. Listeria does not cause habitual abortion in humans. Infection is diagnosed by culture from sterile body fluids such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid and amniotic fluid. The treatment of choice is ampicillin. The patient also should be treated with gentamicin if she has meningitis, endocarditis, or is severly immunocompromised. Early treatment decreases mortality and residual morbidity so it is imperative that each clinician maintain a high index of suspicion for this unusual infection.},

This review includes details on the diverse forms and functions of individual bacteria and attempts to make this information relevant to the care of patients. A series of experimental studies involving host-bacterium interactions illustrates the probability that most bacteria exposed to a deleterious host environment can assume a form quite different from that of a free-living bacterium. A hypothesis is offered for a kind of reproductive cycle of morphologically aberrant bacteria as a means to relate their diverse tissue forms to each other. Data on the basic biology of persistent bacteria are correlated with expression of disease and particularly the mechanisms of both latency and chronicity that typify certain infections. For example, in certain streptococcal and nocardial infections, it has been clearly established that wall-defective forms can be induced in a suitable host. These organisms can survive and persist in a latent state within the host, and they can cause pathologic responses compatible with disease. A series of cases illustrating idiopathic conditions in which cryptic bacteria have been implicated in the expression of disease is presented. These conditions include nephritis, rheumatic fever, aphthous stomatitis, idiopathic hematuria, Crohn's disease, and mycobacterial infections. By utilizing PCR, previously nonculturable bacilli have been identified in patients with Whipple's disease and bacillary angiomatosis. Koch's postulates may have to be redefined in terms of molecular data when dormant and nonculturable bacteria are implicated as causative agents of mysterious diseases.},

  abstract = {L-forms are variants of common bacteria that can grow and proliferate without a cell wall. Little is known about their molecular cell biology but they undergo a remarkable mode of proliferation that is independent of the normally essential FtsZ-dependent division machinery. We have isolated a strain of Bacillus subtilis that can quickly and quantitatively convert from the walled to the L-form state. Analysis of the transition process identified an unexpected `escape' step needed for L-form emergence from the rod. Mutations in two different genes, walR and sepF, contribute to the high frequency of escape: walR, a transcriptional regulator involved in cell wall homeostasis; and sepF, required for accurate and efficient cell division. Time-lapse imaging shows that the mutations act by facilitating the release of the L-form from its walled parent cell but that they act in different ways. The walR mutation renders the activity of the protein partially constitutive, inappropriately upregulating the activity of autolytic enzymes that weaken the cell wall. The sepF mutation probably works by perturbing the formation of a properly constructed division septum, generating a mechanical breach in the wall. The new strain provides a powerful experimental system for studying the genetics and cell biology of L-forms.},

DNA sequence analysis of a positive clone revealed the presence of an open reading frame of 287 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 30.4 kDa. Comparison of this sequence with flagellins from other bacteria showed a significant degree of homology in both the N- and C-terminal parts of the protein. The flagellin mRNA was determined to be 1 kb in size, which is the expected size for a monocistronic mRNA, and the temperature-dependent expression of flagellin was found to be regulated at the transcriptional level. Southern blot analysis, using the flagellin gene as probe, indicated that L. monocytogenes can be divided into two groups. These groups correspond to the flagellar antigens AB and ABC, respectively, as well as to the two types of L. monocytogenes based on the DNA sequence of the listeriolysin gene.},

  abstract = {Microbial infection of the endothelium with the resultant up-regulation of adhesion molecule expression and stimulated leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells can promote an inflammatory response. Previous work demonstrated that Listeria monocytogenes can replicate within cultured endothelial cells; thus, we tested whether L. monocytogenes infection of HUVEC stimulated an inflammatory phenotype on these cells. Infection with 10(4) CFU of bacteria increased neutrophil adhesion to HUVEC 40-fold and up-regulated E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression. Approximately 80\% of neutrophil adhesion to infected HUVEC was blocked by anti-E-selectin mAb, 35\% was blocked by anti-CD18 mAb, and anti-vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 mAb was without effect. Microscopy of infected HUVEC monolayers showed that neutrophils bound to infected and uninfected cells and that infected and uninfected HUVEC expressed E-selectin. Interestingly, uninfected HUVEC that bound neutrophils or expressed E-selectin typically were adjacent to infected cells. However, infected monolayers did not produce soluble factors that stimulated E-selectin expression on uninfected cells. Nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of the transcription factor NF-kappaB accompanied the HUVEC response, and hemolysin secretion appeared critical for stimulating HUVEC. These studies show that L. monocytogenes infection stimulates up-regulation of adhesion molecule expression on endothelial cells, resulting in neutrophil adhesion to them. This response includes induction of an inflammatory phenotype on uninfected cells and may be triggered by listeriolysin O-mediated activation of host response mechanisms. Additionally, cell-to-cell spread of L. monocytogenes throughout the monolayer, without stimulating secondarily infected endothelial cells for neutrophil adhesion, is a possible means of immune avoidance.},

  abstract = {Listeria monocytogenes infection of endothelial cells upregulates surface expression of adhesion molecules and stimulates neutrophil adhesion to infected cell monolayers. The experiments presented here tested the roles of specific bacterial virulence factors as triggers for this inflammatory phenotype and function. Human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) monolayers were infected with wild-type L. monocytogenes or L. monocytogenes mutants; then surface expression of E-selectin and neutrophil adhesion were measured. The results showed that {$\Delta$}hly and prfA mutants were the most crippled, requiring 100-fold more mutant bacteria than wild-type bacteria for analogous stimulation. By comparison, L. monocytogenes mutants with deletions of actA, inlA, inlB, inlAB, plcA, and plcB resembled their parent strains, and a {$\Delta$}plcA {$\Delta$}plcB mutant displayed decreased intracellular growth rate but only a minor decrease in stimulation of E-selectin or neutrophil adhesion. Other experiments showed that cytochalasin D-treated HUVEC monolayers bound bacteria, but internalization and increased surface E-selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression were profoundly inhibited. However, cytochalasin D had no effect on the HUVEC response to stimulation with lipopolysaccharide or tumor necrosis factor alpha. These data suggest that listeriolysin O production by infecting L. monocytogenes contributes to increased expression of surface E-selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule-1, but neither it nor intracellular replication are directly responsible for this event. Nonetheless it is possible that listeriolysin O potentiates the effect(s) of an other molecule(s) that directly triggers this response. Additionally, cellular invasion by L. monocytogenes appears to be critical for initiating the HUVEC response, potentially by providing a signal which results in upregulation of the necessary bacterial genes.},

Increases or decreases in cd protein levels in a given region of the embryo cause a corresponding posterior or anterior shift of anterior aniagen in the embryo. The bcd protein thus has the properties of a morphogen that autonomously determines positions in the anterior half of the embryo.},

  abstract = {Many bacteria utilize actin-like proteins to direct peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis. MreB and MreB-like proteins are thought to act as scaffolds, guiding the localization and activity of key PG-synthesizing proteins during cell elongation. Despite their critical role in viability and cell shape maintenance, very little is known about how the activity of MreB family proteins is regulated. Using a Bacillus subtilis misexpression screen, we identified two genes, yodL and yisK, that when misexpressed lead to loss of cell width control and cell lysis. Expression analysis suggested that yodL and yisK are previously uncharacterized Spo0A-regulated genes, and consistent with these observations, a {$\Delta$}yodL {$\Delta$}yisK mutant exhibited reduced sporulation efficiency. Suppressors resistant to YodL's killing activity occurred primarily in mreB mutants and resulted in amino acid substitutions at the interface between MreB and the highly conserved morphogenic protein RodZ, whereas suppressors resistant to YisK occurred primarily in mbl mutants and mapped to Mbl's predicted ATP-binding pocket. YodL's shape-altering activity appears to require MreB, as a {$\Delta$}mreB mutant was resistant to the effects of YodL but not YisK. Similarly, YisK appears to require Mbl, as a {$\Delta$}mbl mutant was resistant to the cell-widening effects of YisK but not of YodL. Collectively, our results suggest that YodL and YisK likely modulate MreB and Mbl activity, possibly during the early stages of sporulation. IMPORTANCE The peptidoglycan (PG) component of the cell envelope confers structural rigidity to bacteria and protects them from osmotic pressure. MreB and MreB-like proteins are thought to act as scaffolds for PG synthesis and are essential in bacteria exhibiting nonpolar growth. Despite the critical role of MreB-like proteins, we lack mechanistic insight into how their activities are regulated. Here, we describe the discovery of two B. subtilis proteins, YodL and YisK, which modulate MreB and Mbl activities. Our data suggest that YodL specifically targets MreB, whereas YisK targets Mbl. The apparent specificities with which YodL and YisK are able to differentially target MreB and Mbl make them potentially powerful tools for probing the mechanics of cytoskeletal function in bacteria.},

The culture medium for maintenance of these L forms must contain an electrolyte in a concentration of 1\% or sucrose in a concentration of 10\%. The electrolytes NaCl, KCl, or MgSO4 were used in both induction and maintenance media. Induction of L forms occurred more rapidly on media containing KCl. Listeria L forms had the same fermentation reactions as the parent bacterium. The L-form growth in liquid medium was slow, not extensive, and appeared as clumps on the bottom of culture tubes. The morphology of Listeria L forms was similar to that reported for other bacterial L forms. The L forms derived from strain 10403, serotype 1, were stable after two or more passages on penicillin media. They did not revert to the bacterial form after 40 subcultures on penicillin-free media. Some L-form colonies derived from strain 10403 did revert to the bacterial form when transferred directly from induction plates to penicillin-free media. Studies of the growth characteristics for L forms derived from strain 10403 gave the following results: an optimal temperature of 30 C, high electrolyte or sucrose concentration necessary for induction and maintenance, and no requirement for serum.},

  abstract = {Exploration of protein function and interaction is critical for discovering links among genomics, proteomics, and disease state; yet, the immense complexity of proteomics found in biological systems currently limits our investigational capacity. Although affinity and autofluorescent tags are widely employed for protein analysis, these methods have been met with limited success because they lack specificity and require multiple fusion tags and genetic constructs. As an alternative approach, the innovative HaloTag protein fusion platform allows protein function and interaction to be comprehensively analyzed using a single genetic construct with multiple capabilities. This is accomplished using a simplified process, in which a variable HaloTag ligand binds rapidly to the HaloTag protein (usually linked to the protein of interest) with high affinity and specificity. In this review, we examine all current applications of the HaloTag technology platform for biomedical applications, such as the study of protein isolation and purification, protein function, protein?protein and protein?DNA interactions, biological assays, in vitro cellular imaging, and in vivo molecular imaging. In addition, novel uses of the HaloTag platform are briefly discussed along with potential future applications.},

  abstract = {The peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall is a defining feature of the bacteria. It emerged very early in evolution and must have contributed significantly to the success of these organisms. The wall features prominently in our thinking about bacterial cell function, and its synthesis involves the action of several dozen proteins that are normally essential for viability. Surprisingly, it turns out to be relatively simple to generate bacterial genetic variants called L-forms that completely lack PG. They grow robustly provided that lack of the cell wall is compensated for by an osmoprotective growth medium. Although their existence has been noted and studied on and off for many decades, it is only recently that modern molecular and cellular methods have been applied to L-forms. We used Bacillus subtilis as an experimental model to understand the molecular basis for the L-form switch. Key findings included the discovery that L-forms use an unusual blebbing, or tubulation and scission mechanism to proliferate. This mechanism is completely independent of the normal FtsZ-based division machinery and seems to require only an increased rate of membrane synthesis, leading to an increased surface area-to-volume ratio. Antibiotics that block cell wall precursor synthesis, such as phosphomycin, efficiently induce the L-form switch without the need for genetic change. The same antibiotics turned out to induce a similar L-form switch in a wide range of bacteria, including Escherichia coli, in which we showed that proliferation was again FtsZ-independent. Aside from further basic science, future work on L-forms is likely to focus on their possible role in chronic or recurrent infections, their use as a model in studies of the origins of life, and possibly, biotechnological applications.},

  abstract = {Cold shock-domain family proteins (Csps) are highly conserved nucleic acid binding proteins regulating the expression of various genes including those involved in stress resistance and virulence in bacteria. We show here that Csps are involved in virulence, cell aggregation and flagella-based extracellular motility of Listeria monocytogenes. A L. monocytogenes mutant deleted in all three csp genes ({$\Delta$}cspABD) is attenuated with respect to human macrophage infection as well as virulence in a zebrafish infection model. Moreover, this mutant is incapable of aggregation and fails to express surface flagella or exhibit swarming motility. An evaluation of double csp gene deletion mutant ({$\Delta$}cspBD, {$\Delta$}cspAD and {$\Delta$}cspAB) strains that produce single csp genes showed that there is redundancy as well as functional differences among the three L. monocytogenes Csps in their contributions to virulence, cellular aggregation, flagella production, and swarming motility. Protein and mRNA expression analysis further showed impaired expression of key virulence and motility genes in the csp mutants. Our observations at protein and mRNA level suggest Csp-dependent expression regulation of these genes at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. In a mutant lacking all csp genes ({$\Delta$}cspABD) as well as those possessing single csp genes ({$\Delta$}cspBD, {$\Delta$}cspAD, and {$\Delta$}cspAB) we detected reduced levels of proteins or activity as well as transcripts from the prfA, hly, mpl, and plcA genes suggesting a Csp-dependent transcriptional regulation of these genes. These csp mutants also had reduced or completely lacked ActA proteins and cell surface flagella but contained elevated actA and flaA mRNA levels compared to the parental wild type strain suggesting Csp involvement in post-transcriptional regulation of these genes. Overall, our results suggest that Csps contribute to the expression regulation of virulence and flagella-associated genes thereby promoting host pathogenicity, cell aggregation and flagella-based motility processes in L. monocytogenes.},

  abstract = {The C-terminal cell wall binding domains (CBDs) of phage endolysins direct the enzymes to their binding ligands on the bacterial cell wall with high affinity and specificity. The Listeria monocytogenes Ply118, Ply511, and PlyP40 endolysins feature related CBDs which recognize the directly cross-linked peptidoglycan backbone structure of Listeria. However, decoration with fluorescently labeled CBDs primarily occurs at the poles and septal regions of the rod-shaped cells. To elucidate the potential role of secondary cell wall-associated carbohydrates such as the abundant wall teichoic acid (WTA) on this phenomenon, we investigated CBD binding using L. monocytogenes serovar 1/2 and 4 cells deficient in WTA. Mutants were obtained by deletion of two redundant tagO homologues, whose products catalyze synthesis of the WTA linkage unit. While inactivation of either tagO1 (EGDe lmo0959) or tagO2 (EGDe lmo2519) alone did not affect WTA content, removal of both alleles following conditional complementation yielded WTA-deficient Listeria cells. Substitution of tagO from an isopropyl-{$\beta$}-d-thiogalactopyranoside-inducible single-copy integration vector restored the original phenotype. Although WTA-deficient cells are viable, they featured severe growth inhibition and an unusual coccoid morphology. In contrast to CBDs from other Listeria phage endolysins which directly utilize WTA as binding ligand, the data presented here show that WTAs are not required for attachment of CBD118, CBD511, and CBDP40. Instead, lack of the cell wall polymers enables unrestricted spatial access of CBDs to the cell wall surface, indicating that the abundant WTA can negatively regulate sidewall localization of the cell wall binding domains.},

  abstract = {Neuroblastoma is the second most common pediatric malignancy, characterized by a high rate of unexplained spontaneous remissions. Much progress has been made in understanding neuroblastoma differentiation triggered by certain agents such as retinoic acid. However, little is known about the signalling pathways that lead to differentiation of neuroblastoma cells due to serum withdrawal. We found that in Neuro2a neuroblastoma cells, EGFR, ERK1/2 and Akt showed increased phosphorylation after serum withdrawal, and that the activation of EGFR was necessary for the activation of Akt and ERK1/2. Inhibition of EGFR, ERK1/2 and PI3K blocked neuroblastoma differentiation after serum withdrawal. Interestingly, addition of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) abrogated serum-withdrawal induced neuroblastoma differentiation, as well as the activation of EGFR. Our results demonstrate a novel role for serum-derived lipoproteins in the control of receptor tyrosine kinase activity.},

A diverse range of macromolecules are suitable for constructing such `artificial viruses'. However, proteins, either man-made or from natural sources, are especially convenient for mimicking the viral functions critical for gene transfer. Cell penetration is a critical step for the delivery of nucleic acids in sufficient amounts and hence for reaching satisfactory transgene expression levels. Membrane-active peptides have shown great promise because of their positive role in cross-membrane transport and intracellular trafficking, and they have been incorporated into different artificial viruses. In this review, we will discuss the biological properties of these peptides together with the newest rational approaches designed to optimize their application.},

While computational tools have previously been developed to support various aspects of genome-wide association studies, there is currently a need for informatics solutions that facilitate the integration of data from multiple sources., Results: Here we present GWAS Analyzer, a database driven web-based tool that integrates genotype and phenotype data, association analysis results and genomic annotations from multiple public resources. GWAS Analyzer contains features for browsing these interrelated data, exploring phenotypic values by family or genotype, and filtering association results based on multiple criteria. The utility of the tool has been demonstrated by a genome-wide association study of human in vitro susceptibility to bacterial infection. GWAS Analyzer facilitated management of large sets of phenotype and genotype data, analysis of phenotypic variation and heritability, and most importantly, generation of a refined set of candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The tool revealed a SNP that was experimentally validated to be associated with increased cell death among Salmonella infected HapMap cell lines., Availability: http://www.nwrce.org/gwas-analyzer, Contact: mbrittna@u.washington.edu, Supplementary Information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {The emergence of the first polymers played an essential role in the transition from the physicochemical to the biological domain, a perception that embodied many different world paradigms relying on only one primal polymer. However, biological complexity would have appeared with an increasing set of associated chemistries and molecular interactions of many different macromolecules. In agreement with this notion, here, the purpose is to focus specific attention on current knowledge of modern biochemistry of a set of widespread polymers likely present in the Last Universal Common Ancestor synthesized by nontemplate-driven reactions with references to their abiotic synthesis. The proposed overview describes the manner in which these polymers could have organized around two polymerization reaction cycles and integrated into a minimal organizational closure at the early stages of living systems, independently of template replication processes. This hypothesis could provide an alternative conceptual framework to evaluate a plausible scenario addressing the transition from nonliving to protocellular systems.},

It is important to understand the catalytic mechanisms of StDAPDH and other enzymes in this family. In this study, based on an evolutionary analysis and examination of catalytic activity, the meso-DAPDH enzymes can be divided into two types. Type I showed highly preferable activity toward meso-diaminopimelate (meso-DAP), and type II exhibited obviously reversible amination activity with a broad substrate spectrum. StDAPDH belongs to type II. A quaternary structure analysis revealed that insertions/deletions (indels) and a loss of quaternary structure resulted in divergence among members of the meso-DAPDH family. A structure alignment of StDAPDH with a representative of type I, the meso-DAPDH from Corynebacterium glutamicum (CgDAPDH), indicated that they had the same folding. Based on sequence and conservation analyses, two amino acid residues of StDAPDH, R35 and R71, were found to be highly conserved within type II while also distinct from each other between the subtypes. Site mutagenesis studies identified R71 as a substrate preference-related residue of StDAPDH, which may serve as an indicator of the amination preference of type II. These results deepen the present understanding of the meso-DAPDH family and provide a solid foundation for the discovery and engineering of meso-DAPDH for d-amino acid biosynthesis., IMPORTANCE The l-form of amino acids is typically more abundant than the d-form. However, the d-form has many important pharmaceutical applications. meso-Diaminopimelate dehydrogenase (meso-DAPDH) from Symbiobacterium thermophilum (StDAPDH) was the first member of meso-DAPDH known to catalyze the amination of 2-keto acids to produce d-amino acids. Accordingly, we analyzed the evolution of meso-DAPDH proteins and found that they form two groups, i.e., type I proteins, which show high preference toward meso-diaminopimelate (meso-DAP), and type II proteins, which show a broad substrate spectrum. We examined the differences in sequence, ternary structure, and quaternary structure to determine the mechanisms underlying the functional differences between the type I and type II lineages. These results will facilitate the identification of additional meso-DAPDHs and may provide guidance to protein engineering studies for d-amino acid biosynthesis.},

Listeriolysin O (LLO) is a secreted pore-forming protein essential for the escape of L. monocytogenes from the vacuole formed upon initial internalization. However, its role in intracellular growth and cell-to-cell spread events has not been testable by a genetic approach. In this study, purified six-His-tagged LLO (HisLLO) was noncovalently coupled to the surface of nickel-treated LLO-negative mutants. Bound LLO mediated vacuolar escape in approximately 2\% of the mutants. After 5.5 h of growth, cytosolic bacteria were indistinguishable from wild-type bacteria with regard to formation of pseudopod-like extensions, here termed listeriopods, and spread to adjacent cells. However, bacteria in adjacent cells failed to multiply and were found in double-membrane vacuoles. Addition of bound LLO to mutants lacking LLO and two distinct phospholipases C (PLCs) also resulted in spread to adjacent cells, but these triple mutants became trapped in multiple-membrane vacuoles that are reminiscent of autophagocytic vacuoles. These studies show that neither LLO nor the PLCs are necessary for listeriopod formation and uptake of bacteria into neighboring cells but that LLO is required for the escape of L. monocytogenes from the double-membrane vacuole that forms upon cell-to-cell spread.},

  abstract = {A well-accepted method for identification of microorganisms uses matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization\textendash time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) coupled to analysis software which identifies and classifies the organism according to its ribosomal protein spectral profile. The method, called MALDI biotyping, is widely used in clinical diagnostics and has partly replaced conventional microbiological techniques such as biochemical identification due to its shorter time to result (minutes for MALDI biotyping versus hours or days for classical phenotypic or genotypic identification). Besides its utility for identifying bacteria, MS-based identification has been shown to be applicable also to yeasts and molds. A limitation to this method, however, is that accurate identification is most reliably achieved on the species level on the basis of reference mass spectra, making further phylogenetic classification unreliable. Here, it is shown that combining tryptic digestion of the acid/organic solvent extracted (classical biotyping preparation) and resolubilized proteins, nano-liquid chromatography (nano-LC), and subsequent identification of the peptides by MALDI-tandem TOF (MALDI-TOF/TOF) mass spectrometry increases the discrimination power to the level of subspecies. As a proof of concept, using this targeted proteomics workflow, we have identified subspecies-specific biomarker peptides for three Salmonella subspecies, resulting in an extension of the mass range and type of proteins investigated compared to classical MALDI biotyping. This method therefore offers rapid and cost-effective identification and classification of microorganisms at a deeper taxonomic level.},

  abstract = {Invasion of nonphagocytic cells, a critical property of Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) that enables it to cross host barriers, is mediated by the interaction of two bacterial surface proteins, InlA and InlB, with their respective receptors E-cadherin and c-Met. Although InlA\textendash E-cadherin interaction is necessary and sufficient for Lm crossing of the intestinal barrier, both InlA and InlB are required for Lm crossing of the placental barrier. The mechanisms underlying these differences are unknown. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K) is involved in both InlA- and InlB-dependent pathways. Indeed, InlA-dependent entry requires PI3-K activity but does not activate it, whereas InlB\textendash c-Met interaction activates PI3-K. We show that Lm intestinal target cells exhibit a constitutive PI3-K activity, rendering InlB dispensable for InlA-dependent Lm intestinal barrier crossing. In contrast, the placental barrier does not exhibit constitutive PI3-K activity, making InlB necessary for InlA-dependent Lm placental invasion. Here, we provide the molecular explanation for the respective contributions of InlA and InlB to Lm host barrier invasion, and reveal the critical role of InlB in rendering cells permissive to InlA-mediated invasion. This study shows that PI3-K activity is critical to host barrier permissiveness to microbes, and that pathogens exploit both similarities and differences of host barriers to disseminate.},

  abstract = {Listeria monocytogenes is a facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen that is frequently associated with food-borne infection. Of particular concern is the ability of L. monocytogenes to breach the blood-brain barrier, leading to life-threatening meningitis and encephalitis. The mechanisms used by bacterial pathogens to infect the brain are not fully understood. Here we show that L. monocytogenes is able to utilize vimentin for invasion of host cells. Vimentin is a type III intermediate filament protein within the cytosol but is also expressed on the host cell surface. We found that L. monocytogenes interaction with surface-localized vimentin promoted bacterial uptake. Furthermore, in the absence of vimentin, L. monocytogenes colonization of the brain was severely compromised in mice. The L. monocytogenes virulence factor InlF was found to bind vimentin and was necessary for optimal bacterial colonization of the brain. These studies reveal a novel receptor-ligand interaction that enhances infection of the brain by L. monocytogenes and highlights the importance of surface vimentin in host-pathogen interactions. IMPORTANCE Listeria monocytogenes is an intracellular bacterial pathogen that is capable of invading numerous host cells during infection. L. monocytogenes can cross the blood-brain barrier, leading to life-threatening meningitis. Here we show that an L. monocytogenes surface protein, InlF, is necessary for optimal colonization of the brain in mice. Furthermore, in the absence of vimentin, a cytosolic intermediate filament protein that is also present on the surface of brain endothelial cells, colonization of the brain was significantly impaired. We further show that InlF binds vimentin to mediate invasion of host cells. This work identifies InlF as a bacterial surface protein with specific relevance for infection of the brain and underscores the significance of host cell surface vimentin interactions in microbial pathogenesis.},

Relatively few intracellular bacteria escape the phagosomal compartment with the help of cytolytic (pore-forming) proteins and replicate in the host cell cytosol. Without such toxins, intracellular bacteria cannot reach this cellular compartment. To circumvent the requirement of an ``escape'' step, we developed a procedure allowing the efficient direct injection of bacteria into the cytosol of mammalian cells. With this technique, we show that most bacteria, including extracellular bacteria and intracellular pathogens that normally reside in a vacuole, are unable to replicate in the cytosol of the mammalian cells. In contrast, microorganisms that replicate in the cytosol, such as Listeria monocytogenes, Shigella flexneri, and, to some extent, enteroinvasive Escherichia coli, are able to multiply in this cellular compartment after microinjection. Further L. monocytogenes with deletion in its PrfA-regulated hpt gene was found to be impaired in replication when injected into the cytosol. Complementation of the hpt mutation with a plasmid carrying the wild-type hpt gene restored the replication ability in the cytosol. These data indicate that cytosolic intracellular pathogens have evolved specific mechanisms to grow in this compartment of mammalian cells.},

The small, dense, nonvesiculated L-form is envisioned as the central (core) element. It was seen to divide and bud rapidly. In addition, the dense forms appeared to be capable of growth and development within vesicles of mature mother forms. When these forms were released from the vesicles into the surrounding fluid medium, further growth occurred, resulting in the development of immature and ultimately mature mother forms. Under conditions unfavorable for L-form growth, these dense forms developed first into transitional forms and then into the bacterial form. These dense forms might therefore be considered as undifferentiated ``stem cells' with the capacity to develop along several different routes, depending upon the stimulus received.},

  abstract = {Invasion of endothelial tissues may be crucial in a Listeria monocytogenes infection leading to meningitis and/or encephalitis. Internalization of L. monocytogenes into endothelial cells has been previously demonstrated by using human umbilical vein endothelial cells as a model system. However, during the crossing of the blood-brain barrier, L. monocytogenes most likely encounters brain microvascular endothelial cells which are strikingly different from macrovascular or umbilical vein endothelial cells. In the present study human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) were used to study the interaction of L. monocytogenes with endothelial cells, which closely resemble native microvascular endothelial cells of the brain. We show thatL. monocytogenes invades HBMEC in an InlB-dependent and wortmannin-insensitive manner. Once within the HBMEC, L. monocytogenes replicates efficiently over a period of at least 18 h, moves intracellularly by inducing actin tail formation, and spreads from cell to cell. Using a green fluorescent protein-expressingL. monocytogenes strain, we present direct evidence that HBMEC are highly resistant to damage by intracellularly growingL. monocytogenes. Infection of HBMEC with L. monocytogenes results in foci of heavily infected, but largely undamaged endothelial cells. Heterologous plaque assays with L. monocytogenes-infected P388D1 macrophages as vectors demonstrate efficient spreading of L. monocytogenes into HBMEC, fibroblasts, hepatocytes, and epithelial cells, and this phenomenon is independent of the inlC gene product.},

Whereas the internalin-dependent crossing of the intestinal epithelium and the fetoplacental barrier have been subject to intensive investigation, limited research elucidating the crossing of the human bloodecerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) has been reported. We have recently established a functional in vitro model of the BCSFB based on human choroid plexus papilloma (HIBCPP) cells. We show polarized expression of receptors involved in listerial invasion (i.e. E-Cadherin, Met) in HIBCPP cells. Infecting HIBCPP cells with the L. monocytogenes strain EGD, we demonstrate polar invasion exclusively from the in vivo relevant basolateral cell side. Intracellular listeria were found in vacuoles and the cytoplasm, where they were often associated with ``actin tail''-like structures. Furthermore, the L. monocytogenes wild type strain shows significantly higher internalization rates than isogenic mutants lacking either InlA, InlB or both surface proteins. Deletion of either one or both proteins leads to a similarly decreased invasion, suggesting an interdependent function of InlA and InlB during invasion of choroid plexus epithelial cells.},

  abstract = {Oral administration of human serum immunoglobulin reduces the duration of diarrhea and of rotaviral excretion in children. To investigate the in vitro effects of immunoglobulin on virusenterocyte interaction, Caco-2 cells were infected with Rotavirus strain SA11. Immunoglobulin was added prior to and at various times postinfection. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed with an antibody against VP-6 rotaviral antigen. Cell viability and monolayer transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) were monitored. Immunofluorescence showed a perinuclear distribution in 90\% of cells.Rotavirus infection induced a progressive decrease in TEER and a parallel reduction in cell viability, depending on viral load. Preincubation of the virus with immunoglobulin prevented cell infection as judged by immunofluorescence. Immunoglobulin addition to infected cells partially prevented the decrease in TEER and induced a later shift of TEER toward increasing values, suggesting restoration of monolayer's integrity. The efficacy of immunoglobulin depended on its concentration and on the time of its addition. These results indicate that immunoglobulin is effective in preventing infection and in reducing cell damage, through a direct anti-Rotavirus action and may indicate that immunoglobulin should be administered in the early phase of diarrhea, to reduce the severity ofRotavirus infection.},

  abstract = {The Gram-positive intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes is endowed with 17 sets of genes encoding two-component systems. L. monocytogenes is closely related to the Gram-positive model bacterium Bacillus subtilis, in which we have shown previously that the DegS/DegU system plays a central role in controlling stationary phase adaptive responses, including degradative enzyme synthesis and competence. Although an orthologue of the DegU response regulator is present in L. monocytogenes, the gene encoding the cognate DegS kinase is conspicuously absent. We have inactivated the degU gene of L. monocytogenes and shown that DegU negatively regulates its own synthesis. Direct binding of L. monocytogenes DegU to its own promoter region was shown in vitro by gel mobility shift and DNase I footprinting experiments. DegU was also shown to bind upstream from the motB operon, which also encodes the GmaR anti-repressor of flagellar synthesis. In contrast to the situation in B. subtilis, DegU was shown to be essential for flagellar synthesis and bacterial motility in L. monocytogenes and is cotranscribed with the yviA gene located downstream. We also show that DegU is required for growth at high temperatures, adherence to plastic surfaces and the formation of efficient biofilms by L. monocytogenes. DegU plays a role in virulence of L. monocytogenes as well: in a murine intravenous infection model, an 11-fold increase in LD50 was observed for the degU mutant. Taken together, our results indicate that despite the lack of the DegS kinase, DegU is fully functional as an orphan response regulator, and plays a central role in controlling several crucial adaptive responses in L. monocytogenes.},

The extracellular domain of cadherins contains characteristic repeats that regulate homophilic and heterophilic interactions during adhesion and cell sorting. Although cadherins may have originated to facilitate mechanical cell\textendash cell adhesion, they have evolved to function in many other aspects of morphogenesis. These additional roles rely on cadherin interactions with a wide range of binding partners that modify their expression and adhesion activity by local regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and diverse signaling pathways. Here we examine how different members of the cadherin family act in different developmental contexts, and discuss the mechanisms involved.},

The pH of the extraction buffer was of the utmost importance, since it was demonstrated that a pH {$>$} 5 would give rise to false signals. Furthermore, modifying the composition of the extraction buffer, all formazan dye grains were solubilised, totally. A direct comparison with published methods demonstrated that only the modified method would yield 100\% higher signals without increasing the background. In contrast to previous reports, it was shown that phenol red does not interfere with the measurements and no washing steps are required since all ingredients can be added subsequently. Serum proteins at concentrations up to 25\% have no influence on the result. All samples can be measured in an ELISA scanner at 570 nm with little intra-assay variation.},

Now, by application of a modified Triton X-100 treatment, we are able to demonstrate that M. pneumoniae possesses a cytoskeleton consisting of a blade-like rod and a peripheral lining located close to the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane, exhibiting features of a highly regular network. Attached "stalks" may support the cytoplasmic membrane. The rod was connected to the cell periphery by "spokes" and showed a defined ultrastructure. Its proximal end was found to be attached to a wheel-like complex. Fibrils extended from the proximal end of the rod into the cytoplasm.},

It was also tested for its ability to prevent L-form biofilm formation on stainless steel and compared with an organic acid (lactic) at L-form biofilm inactivation on stainless steel. The bred phage lysed only L-forms of L. monocytogenes in broth culture and only plaqued on L-form lawns. Likewise, the unbred phage performed similarly with classical cell-walled culture and lawns. The bred phage successfully inhibited L-form biofilm formation on stainless steel and was as successful as lactic acid (130 ppm) at inactivating pre-formed L-form biofilms. Both reduced viable cell numbers by 3-1og cycles over a 6 h period.

Plasmid vectors, reporter genes, systems designed for transposon mutagenesis, heterologous expression systems, integration vectors, and transducing phage have all greatly advanced the experimental capacity to generate, characterize, and complement mutations within L. monocytogenes and to define functional roles of gene products. This chapter provides a brief description of the genetic tools currently available for use with L. monocytogenes. Key references are given throughout this description to provide sources for expanded details on plasmid constructions, assay conditions, and other technical aspects. The variety of genetic tools described is meant to be representative of the resources available to those interested in L. monocytogenes genetics. More widely used tools for studying expression profiles of bacteria are whole-genome DNA macro- and microarrays, which provide a comprehensive transcriptional analysis enabling researchers to view the organism as a system. Several reporter genes developed for use in other systems have proven useful for monitoring L. monocytogenes transcriptional gene regulation. Transcriptional fusions to reporter genes such as lacZ, gus, gfp, lux, and cat have all been constructed in L. monocytogenes and have been used successfully to monitor patterns of bacterial gene expression in culture and within infected cells and animals. The advantages and/or disadvantages of some of these reporter systems are discussed briefly.},

  abstract = {Determination of the MIC in vitro is often used as the basis for predicting the clinical efficacy of antibiotics. Listeriae are uniformly susceptible in vitro to most common antibiotics except cephalosporins and fosfomycin. However, the clinical outcome is poor. This is partially because listeriae are refractory to the bactericidal mechanisms of many antibiotics, especially to ampicillin-amoxicillin, which still is regarded as the drug of choice. A true synergism can be achieved by adding gentamicin. Another point is that listeriae are able to reside and multiply within host cells, e.g., macrophages, hepatocytes, and neurons, where they are protected from antibiotics in the extracellular fluid. Only a few agents penetrate, accumulate, and reach the cytosol of host cells, where the listeriae are found. Furthermore, certain host cells may exclude antibiotics from any intracellular compartment. Thus, determination of the antibacterial efficacy of a drug against listeriae in cell cultures may be a better approximation of potential therapeutic value. Certain host cells may have acquired the property of excluding certain antibiotics, for example macrolides, from intracellular spaces, which might explain therapeutic failures of antibiotic therapy in spite of low MICs. Animal models do not completely imitate human listeriosis, which is characterized by meningitis, encephalitis, soft tissue and parenchymal infections, and bacteremia. Meningitis produced in rabbits is a hyperacute disease, whereby most listeriae lie extracellularly, fairly accessible to antibiotics that can cross the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. In the murine model of systemic infection, Listeria monocytogenes is located mainly within macrophages and parenchymal cells of the spleen and liver, hardly accessible to certain drugs, such as ampicillin and gentimicin. The therapeutic efficacy of drugs clearly depends on the model used. Thus, for example, the combination of ampicillin with gentamicin acts synergistically in the rabbit meningitis model but not in the mouse model. Since conventional antimicrobial therapy with antibiotics is not satisfactory, particularly in the immunocompromised host (about 30\% of patients with listeriosis die in spite of a rational choice of antibiotics), other possibilities must be considered for therapy as well as prevention. Indeed, listeriae are highly susceptible to several endogenous antibiotics, such as defensins. Bacteriocins produced by related bacterial species, e.g., lactobacilli and enterococci, are rapidly bactericidal. However, unfortunately, the use of such alternative measures along with immunization and immunmodulation is not yet feasible.},

  abstract = {Background The expression and study of recombinant proteins in mammalian culture systems can be complicated during the cell lysis procedure by contaminating proteins from cellular compartments distinct from those within which the protein of interest resides and also by solubility issues that may arise from the use of a single lysis buffer. Partial subcellular fractionation using buffers of increasing stringency, rather than whole cell lysis is one way in which to avoid or reduce this contamination and ensure complete recovery of the target protein. Currently published protocols involve time consuming centrifugation steps which may require expensive equipment and commercially available kits can be prohibitively expensive when handling large or multiple samples. Findings We have established a protocol to sequentially extract proteins from cultured mammalian cells in fractions enriched for cytosolic, membrane bound organellar, nuclear and insoluble proteins. All of the buffers used can be made inexpensively and easily and the protocol requires no costly equipment. While the method was optimized for a specific cell type, we demonstrate that the protocol can be applied to a variety of commonly used cell lines and anticipate that it can be applied to any cell line via simple optimization of the primary extraction step. Conclusion We describe a protocol for the crude subcellular fractionation of cultured mammalian cells that is both straightforward and cost effective and may facilitate the more accurate study of recombinant proteins and the generation of purer preparations of said proteins from cell extracts.},

The patients were followed for 12 to 24 months in a prospective study. Increased titers, i.e., titers more than 2 standard deviations above those of normal controls, were exclusively found in patients chronically colonized with P. aeruginosa and not in patients harboring only Staphylococcus aureus. The frequencies of elevated titers of antibody to the different antigens varied from 100\% (phospholipase C) to 58\% (alkaline protease and exotoxin A) to 15\% (elastase) in the chronically colonized patients. Mean serum titer levels, expressed as multiples of the age-correlated upper normal limit (=1), were significantly higher to phospholipase C in patients with dual colonization with P. aeruginosa and S. aureus than in those colonized only with P. aeruginosa (P less than 0.001). Conversely, the other three antigens showed significantly higher serum antibody titer levels in patients harboring only P. aeruginosa (P less than 0.001). In five patients who became colonized with P. aeruginosa during the study period, serum antibodies to phospholipase C and exotoxin A increased first. Exceptions to the general pattern of antibody responses were found in three patients chronically colonized with Escherichia coli. They showed a delayed enhancement of anti-phospholipase C titers after the chronic P. aeruginosa colonization. Serum titers were not influenced by exacerbations of pulmonary infection or by antimicrobial therapy. The determination of titers of serum antibody to phospholipase C seems to be a valuable indicator of a chronic colonization with P. aeruginosa. The results further suggest that bacterial metabolism and interactions may influence the antibody response.},

  abstract = {To withstand the high intracellular pressure, the cell wall of most bacteria is stabilized by a unique cross-linked biopolymer called murein or peptidoglycan. It is made of glycan strands [poly-(GlcNAc-MurNAc)], which are linked by short peptides to form a covalently closed net. Completely surrounding the cell, the murein represents a kind of bacterial exoskeleton known as the murein sacculus. Not only does the sacculus endow bacteria with mechanical stability, but in addition it maintains the specific shape of the cell. Enlargement and division of the murein sacculus is a prerequisite for growth of the bacterium. Two groups of enzymes, hydrolases and synthases, have to cooperate to allow the insertion of new subunits into the murein net. The action of these enzymes must be well coordinated to guarantee growth of the stress-bearing sacculus without risking bacteriolysis. Protein-protein interaction studies suggest that this is accomplished by the formation of a multienzyme complex, a murein-synthesizing machinery combining murein hydrolases and synthases. Enlargement of both the multilayered murein of gram-positive and the thin, single-layered murein of gram-negative bacteria seems to follow an inside-to-outside growth strategy. New material is hooked in a relaxed state underneath the stress-bearing sacculus before it becomes inserted upon cleavage of covalent bonds in the layer(s) under tension. A model is presented that postulates that maintenance of bacterial shape is achieved by the enzyme complex copying the preexisting murein sacculus that plays the role of a template.},

Here we highlight recent advances in our understanding of polar growth mechanisms in bacteria, with an emphasis on Streptomyces and Agrobacterium.

  abstract = {c-Met is a tyrosine kinase receptor for hepatocyte growth factor and suggested to be involved in oncogenesis ormetastatic phenotypes in many malignancies. Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is a neoplasia characterized by massive invasion of the leukemic cells into various organs. Recently, we have reported frequent hepatic involvement and the relationship between liver invasion and the poor prognosis in ATL. In the present study, we investigated the expression of c-Met in ATL cells and its relation to liver dysfunction. In three of four human T-cell lymphotrophic virus-I-positive T-cell lines, c-Met was expressed both at mRNA and protein levels, whereas it was not expressed in human T-cell lymphoma virus-I-negative T-cell lines. The expressed c-Met should be functional, because hepatocyte growth factor could induce the autophosphorylation of c-Met. Although the viral-transactivating protein Tax has been shown to be involved in the deregulated expression of cellular genes, Tax mRNA was not detected in c-Met mRNA-expressed cell lines. From freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the expression of c-Met mRNA was detected in 10 of 16 ATL patients but not from healthy individuals. Finally, serum transaminase levels were significantly increased in c-Met-positive ATL cases, and all of the infiltrated c-Met-positive cells into liver were shown to be multilobularly nucleated phenotype. Taken together, these data suggest for the first time that c-Met is involved in the liver invasive phenotype of ATL.},

  abstract = {Several bacterial pathogens, including Listeria monocytogenes, Shigella flexneri and Rickettsia spp., have evolved mechanisms to actively spread within human tissues. Spreading is initiated by the pathogen-induced recruitment of host filamentous (F)-actin. F-actin forms a tail behind the microbe, propelling it through the cytoplasm. The motile pathogen then encounters the host plasma membrane, forming a bacterium-containing protrusion that is engulfed by an adjacent cell. Over the past two decades, much progress has been made in elucidating mechanisms of F-actin tail formation. Listeria and Shigella produce tails of branched actin filaments by subverting the host Arp2/3 complex. By contrast, Rickettsia forms tails with linear actin filaments through a bacterial mimic of eukaryotic formins. Compared with F-actin tail formation, mechanisms controlling bacterial protrusions are less well understood. However, recent findings have highlighted the importance of pathogen manipulation of host cell\textendash cell junctions in spread. Listeria produces a soluble protein that enhances bacterial protrusions by perturbing tight junctions. Shigella protrusions are engulfed through a clathrin-mediated pathway at `tricellular junctions'\textemdash specialized membrane regions at the intersection of three epithelial cells. This review summarizes key past findings in pathogen spread, and focuses on recent developments in actin-based motility and the formation and internalization of bacterial protrusions.},

  abstract = {Toxin-antitoxin loci, which encode a toxic protein alongside with either RNA or a protein able to counteract the toxicity, are widespread among archaea and bacteria. These loci are implicated in persistence, and as addiction modules to ensure stable inheritance of plasmids and phages. In type I toxin-antitoxin systems, a small RNA acts as an antitoxin, which prevents the synthesis of the toxin. Most type I toxins are small hydrophobic membrane proteins generally assumed to induce pores, or otherwise permeabilise the cytoplasmic membrane and, as a result, induce cell death by energy starvation. Here we show that this mode of action is not a conserved property of type I toxins. The analysis of the cellular toxicity caused by Bacillus subtilis prophage SP{$\beta$}-encoded toxin BsrG revealed that, surprisingly, it neither dissipates membrane potential nor affects cellular ATP-levels. In contrast, BsrG strongly interferes with the cell envelope biosynthesis, causes membrane invaginations together with delocalisation of the cell wall synthesis machinery and triggers autolysis. Furthermore, efficient inhibition of protein biosynthesis is observed. These findings question the simplistic assumption that small membrane targeting toxins generally act by permeabilising the membrane.},

To define characteristics that determine entry of antimicrobial agents into phagocytes, we studied the uptake of 14 radiolabeled antibiotics by rabbit AM. Cell-antibiotic mixtures were incubated for 2 hr, and at intervals antibiotic uptake was determined by velocity-gradient centrifugation (separation of cells from extracellular antibiotic). Many drugs failed to penetrate AM readily. Cellular concentrations of penicillin G and three cephalosporin antibiotics were much lower than extracellular levels (C/E = less than 0.1 to 0.4). Gentamicin, isoniazid, and tetracycline attained C/E values of 0.5 to 0.8. The more lipid-soluble antibiotics, refampin, lincomycin, and chloramphenicol, were concentrated approximately twofold (C/E = 2) in AM. Ethambutol (C/E = 7) and two erythromycin preparations (C/E = greater than 20) were markedly accumulated by macrophages. In comparison with other antibiotics tested, the uptake of clindamycin was both massive and rapid (C/E = 50 by 30 min). Ethambutol, erythromycin and clindamycin uptakes by AM are dependent upon oxidative metabolic processes. Detailed characterization of clindamycin uptake confirmed that the drug is accumulated by an active transport system. These findings, in association with studies of antibiotic-mediated influence on phagocytes, should provide information useful in establishing guidelines for optimal antibiotic usage.},

The use of super-resolution microscopy in CLEM is an emerging application and while offering the obvious advantages of improved resolution in the fluorescence image, and therefore more precise correlation to electron microscopy (EM) ultrastructure, it also presents new challenges. Choice of fluorophore, method of fixation, and timing of the fluorescence imaging are critical to the success of super-resolution CLEM and the relative importance, and technical difficulty, of each of these factors depends on the type of super-resolution microscopy being employed. This chapter details the method we developed for in-resin super-resolution CLEM using single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) with standard fluorescent proteins (e.g., GFP and mVenus). The key to this approach is being able to preserve not only the fluorescence, but also, and more importantly, the photoswitching ability of the fluorescent proteins throughout the EM sample preparation procedure. Cells are cryofixed using high pressure freezing~for optimal structural preservation and then freeze substituted in tannic acid, which preserves the photoswitching ability of the fluorescent proteins and is essential for high-quality SMLM imaging. Resin sections are then imaged using SMLM, achieving a structural resolution of 40\textendash 50nm and a localization precision of {$\sim$}17nm, followed by transmission electron microscopy. This produces high quality correlative images without the use of specialized fluorescent proteins or antibodies.},

  abstract = {Light-harvesting pigment\textendash protein complexes (PPC) represent the fundamental units through which the photosynthetic organisms absorb sunlight and funnel the energy to the reaction centre for carrying out the primary energy conversion reactions of photosynthesis. Here we apply a multiscale computational strategy to a specific PPC present in the photosystem II of plants and algae (CP29) to investigate in what detail should the environment effects due to protein and membrane/solvent be included for an accurate description of optical spectra. We find that a refinement of the crystal structure is needed before any meaningful quantum chemical calculations of pigment transition energies can be performed. For this purpose we apply classical molecular dynamics simulations of the PPC within its natural environment and we perform ab initio computations of the exciton Hamiltonian of the complex, including the environment either implicitly by the polarizable continuum model (PCM) or explicitly using the polarizable QM/MM methodology (MMPol). However, PCM essentially leads to an unspecific redshift of all transition energies, and MMPol is able to reveal site-specific changes in the optical properties of the pigments. Based on the latter and the excitonic couplings obtained within a polarizable QM/MM methodology, optical spectra are calculated, which are in good qualitative agreement with experimental data. A weakness of the approach is however found in the overestimation of the fluctuations of the excitonic parameters of the pigments along the MD trajectory. An explanation for such a finding in terms of the limits of the force fields commonly used for protein cofactors is presented and discussed.},

Related to this important issue is the essential invulnerability to killing of persisters: cells forming a small subpopulation largely responsible for the recalcitrance of biofilms to chemotherapy. To learn whether death is accompanied by changes in expression of particular genes, we compared transcription profiles of log-phase Escherichia coli treated with bactericidal concentrations of two unrelated antibiotics: ampicillin and ofloxacin. Massive changes in transcription profile were observed in response to either agent, and there was a significant overlap in genes whose transcription was affected. A small group of mostly uncharacterized genes was induced and a much larger set was transcriptionally repressed by both antibiotics. Among the repressed genes were those required for flagellar synthesis, energy metabolism, transport of small molecules, and protein synthesis.},

The intensity of the reaction was positively correlated to numbers of L forms in the skin. L forms also served as the intravenous challenge. In vivo multiplication of L forms was not a prerequisite for the reaction, as it could be produced with nonviable, osmotically lysed L forms. The reaction produced with L forms in the skin was more intense than that produced with the parent bacterial form. These latter observations, coupled with the demonstration that L forms disappeared from the skin (lysed?) after 4 hr, in contrast to bacteria which were recoverable for 72 hr (duration of study), suggest release of endotoxin by L forms as a pathogenic mechanism.},

PTU inhibits melanogenesis by blocking all tyrosinase-dependent steps in the melanin pathway but can be toxic at high concentrations. The embryos remain transparent as long as the PTU treatment is continued. However, PTU treatment must be initiated before the initial pigmentation because it does not remove already formed pigment.

  abstract = {Several virulence factors of Listeria monocytogenes have been identi ed and extensively characterized at the molecular and cell biologic levels, including the hemolysin (listeriolysin O), two distinct phospholipases, a protein (ActA), several internalins, and others. Their study has yielded an impressive amount of information on the mechanisms employed by this facultative intracellular pathogen to interact with mammalian host cells, escape the host cell's killing mechanisms, and spread from one infected cell to others. In addition, several molecular subtyping tools have been developed to facilitate the detection of different strain types and lineages of the pathogen, including those implicated in common-source outbreaks of the disease. Despite these spectacular gains in knowledge, the virulence of L. monocytogenes as a foodborne pathogen remains poorly understood. The available pathogenesis and subtyping data generally fail to provide adequate insight about the virulence of eld isolates and the likelihood that a given strain will cause illness. Possible mechanisms for the apparent prevalence of three serotypes (1/2a, 1/2b, and 4b) in human foodborne illness remain unidenti ed. The propensity of certain strain lineages (epidemic clones) to be implicated in common-source outbreaks and the prevalence of serotype 4b among epidemic-associated strains also remain poorly understood. This review rst discusses current progress in understanding the general features of virulence and pathogenesis of L. monocytogenes. Emphasis is then placed on areas of special relevance to the organism's involvement in human foodborne illness, including (i) the relative prevalence of different serotypes and serotype-speci c features and genetic markers; (ii) the ability of the organism to respond to environmental stresses of relevance to the food industry (cold, salt, iron depletion, and acid); (iii) the speci c features of the major known epidemic-associated lineages; and (iv) the possible reservoirs of the organism in animals and the environment and the pronounced impact of environmental contamination in the food processing facilities. Finally, a discussion is provided on the perceived areas of special need for future research of relevance to food safety, including (i) theoretical modeling studies of niche complexity and contamination in the food processing facilities; (ii) strain databases for comprehensive molecular typing; and (iii) contributions from genomic and proteomic tools, including DNA microarrays for genotyping and expression signatures. Virulence-related genomic and proteomic signatures are expected to emerge from analysis of the genomes at the global level, with the support of adequate epidemiologic data and access to relevant strains.},

However, the mechanism underlying this cellular patterning is unclear. Here, we show that the cellular pattern of the OE is established by cellular rearrangements during development. In the OE, OCs express nectin-2 and N-cadherin, and SCs express nectin-2, nectin-3, E-cadherin, and N-cadherin. Heterophilic trans-interaction between nectin-2 on OCs and nectin-3 on SCs preferentially recruits cadherin via {$\alpha$}-catenin to heterotypic junctions, and the differential distributions of cadherins between junctions promote cellular intercalations, resulting in the formation of the mosaic pattern. These observations are confirmed by model cell systems, and various cellular patterns are generated by the combinatorial expression of nectins and cadherins. Collectively, the synergistic action of nectins and cadherins generates mosaic pattern, which cannot be achieved by a single mechanism.},

  abstract = {The endothelial cells that form capillaries in the brain are highly specialized, with tight junctions that minimize paracellular transport and an array of broad-spectrum efflux pumps that make drug delivery to the brain extremely challenging. One of the major limitations in blood-brain barrier research and the development of drugs to treat central nervous system diseases is the lack of appropriate cell lines. Recent reports indicate that the derivation of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs) from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) may provide a solution to this problem. Here we demonstrate the derivation of hBMECs extended to two new human iPSC lines: BC1 and GFP-labeled BC1. These hBMECs highly express adherens and tight junction proteins VE-cadherin, ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5. The addition of retinoic acid upregulates VE-cadherin expression, and results in a significant increase in transendothelial electrical resistance to physiological values. The permeabilities of tacrine, rhodamine 123, and Lucifer yellow are similar to values obtained for MDCK cells. The efflux ratio for rhodamine 123 across hBMECs is in the range 2\textendash 4 indicating polarization of efflux transporters. Using the rod assay to assess cell organization in small vessels and capillaries, we show that hBMECs resist elongation with decreasing diameter but show progressive axial alignment. The derivation of hBMECs with a blood-brain barrier phenotype from the BC1 cell line highlights that the protocol is robust. The expression of GFP in hBMECs derived from the BC1-GFP cell line provides an important new resource for BBB research.},

In this bacterium, DivIVA is required for precise positioning of the septum at midcell, it contributes to the secretion of autolysins required for the breakdown of peptidoglycan at the septum after the completion of cell division, and it is essential for flagellar motility. While the DivIVA interaction partners for control of division site selection are well established, the proteins connecting DivIVA with autolysin secretion or swarming motility are completely unknown. We set out to identify divIVA alleles in which these three DivIVA functions could be separated, since the question of the degree to which the three functions of L. monocytogenes DivIVA are interlinked could not be answered before. Here, we identify such alleles, and our results show that division site selection, autolysin secretion, and swarming represent three discrete pathways that are independently influenced by DivIVA. These findings provide the required basis for the identification of DivIVA interaction partners controlling autolysin secretion and swarming in the future. IMPORTANCE DivIVA of the pathogenic bacterium Listeria monocytogenes is a central scaffold protein that influences at least three different cellular processes, namely, cell division, protein secretion, and bacterial motility. How DivIVA coordinates these rather unrelated processes is not known. We here identify variants of L. monocytogenes DivIVA, in which these functions are separated from each other. These results have important implications for the models explaining how DivIVA interacts with other proteins.},

  abstract = {Summary {$\beta$}-lactam antibiotics inhibit bacterial cell wall assembly and, under classical microbiological culture conditions that are generally hypotonic, induce explosive cell death. Here, we show that under more physiological, osmoprotective conditions, for various Gram-positive bacteria, lysis is delayed or abolished, apparently because inhibition of class A penicillin-binding protein leads to a block in autolytic activity. Although these cells still then die by other mechanisms, exogenous lytic enzymes, such as lysozyme, can rescue viability by enabling the escape of cell wall-deficient ``L-form'' bacteria. This protective L-form conversion was also observed in macrophages and in an animal model, presumably due to the production of host lytic activities, including lysozyme. Our results demonstrate the potential for L-form switching in the host environment and highlight the unexpected effects of innate immune effectors, such as lysozyme, on antibiotic activity. Unlike previously described dormant persisters, L-forms can continue to proliferate in the presence of antibiotic.},

  abstract = {For bacteria, replication mainly involves growth by binary fission. However, in a very great many natural environments there are examples of phenotypically dormant, non-growing cells that do not replicate immediately and that are phenotypically `nonculturable' on media that normally admit their growth. They thereby evade detection by conventional culture-based methods. Such dormant cells may also be observed in laboratory cultures and in clinical microbiology. They are usually more tolerant to stresses such as antibiotics, and in clinical microbiology they are typically referred to as `persisters'. Bacterial cultures necessarily share a great deal of relatedness, and inclusive fitness theory implies that there are conceptual evolutionary advantages in trading a variation in growth rate against its mean, equivalent to hedging one's bets. There is much evidence that bacteria exploit this strategy widely. We here bring together data that show the commonality of these phenomena across environmental, laboratory and clinical microbiology. Considerable evidence, using methods similar to those common in environmental microbiology, now suggests that many supposedly non-communicable, chronic and inflammatory diseases are exacerbated (if not indeed largely caused) by the presence of dormant or persistent bacteria (the ability of whose components to cause inflammation is well known). This dormancy (and resuscitation therefrom) often reflects the extent of the availability of free iron. Together, these phenomena can provide a ready explanation for the continuing inflammation common to such chronic diseases and its correlation with iron dysregulation. This implies that measures designed to assess and to inhibit or remove such organisms (or their access to iron) might be of much therapeutic benefit.},

  abstract = {Alpha-synuclein ({$\alpha$}-SYN) is expressed during neuronal development and is mainly involved in the modulation of synaptic transmission. Missense mutations and amplifications of this gene have been associated with the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Here, we evaluate whether {$\alpha$}-SYN plays a detrimental role in the phenotypic and morphological regulation of neurons. We also identify the underlying mechanisms of this process in all-trans-retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiated SH-SY5Y cells, which represents dopaminergic (DAergic) phenotype. Our results indicate that overexpression of wild-type or mutant A53T {$\alpha$}-SYN attenuated the RA-induced upregulation of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine transporter as well as neurite outgrowth in SH-SY5Y cells. In addition, GSK-3{$\beta$} inactivation and downstream {$\beta$}-catenin stabilization were associated with RA-induced differentiation, which was attenuated by {$\alpha$}-SYN. Moreover, protein phosphatase 2A was positively regulated by {$\alpha$}-SYN and was implicated in the {$\alpha$}-SYN-mediated interference with RA signaling. The results obtained from SH-SY5Y cells were verified in primary cultures of mesencephalic DAergic neurons from A53T {$\alpha$}-SYN transgenic mice, which represent high levels of {$\alpha$}-SYN and protein phosphatase 2A in the midbrain. The number and length of neurites in tyrosine hydroxylase-positive as well as Tau-positive cells from A53T {$\alpha$}-SYN transgenic mice were significantly lower than those in littermate controls. The current results provide novel insight into the role of {$\alpha$}-SYN in the regulation of neuronal differentiation, including DAergic neurons. Identifying the signaling pathway involved in the {$\alpha$}-SYN-mediated dysregulation of neuronal differentiation could lead to a better understanding of the developmental processes underlying {$\alpha$}-SYN-related pathologies and facilitate the discovery of specifically targeted therapeutics.},

  abstract = {Enterobacter sakazakii is an opportunistic pathogen that causes systemic bacteremia and meningitis with high mortality, and powdered infant formula is a frequent source of this bacterium. However, the mechanisms that this organism uses to invade and translocate through the intestinal barrier are unknown. Using Caco-2 epithelial cells, we were able to demonstrate penetration of E. sakazakii and to determine invasion-associated properties. We found that E. sakazakii entry and invasion were dependent on the exposure time and multiplicity of infection and required bacterial de novo protein synthesis but was independent of cell polarity in the presence of tight junctions. Moreover, the presence of actin filaments and microtubule structures was required, and disruption of the tight junction significantly enhanced the initial association with Caco-2 cells and the efficiency of invasion, which provides a possible explanation for the preferential occurrence of this infection in babies and neonates. This is the first description of E. sakazakii invasion of host intestinal cells, and our findings suggest that this emerging pathogen employs a novel invasion mechanism for development of systemic infection.},

The formation of these bodies starts with the production of small nuclear elements surrounded with a thin cytoplasmic layer; these elements fuse with neighbouring elements and the L-body is complete. Whereas some L-strains reproduce themselves indefinitely, others revert to the bacterial form. Thus the bacterial and the L-forms are now regarded as two different generations of the same organism and my symbiosis theory is abandoned.},

Northern blot analysis suggested that the degU gene product is a transcriptional activator of the flagellin gene, flaA, at 25 \textdegree C. However, the degU gene product had no influence on the transcription of prfA encoding the major virulence regulator, PrfA.

Approaches that provide a mechanistic understanding of how genetic variants function to alter disease susceptibility and why they were substrates of natural selection would complement other approaches to human-genome analysis. Here we use a novel cell-based screen of bacterial infection to identify human variation in Salmonella-induced cell death. A loss-of-function allele of CARD8, a reported inhibitor of the proinflammatory protease caspase-1, was associated with increased cell death in~vitro (p = 0.013). The validity of this association was demonstrated through overexpression of alternative alleles and RNA interference in cells of varying genotype. Comparison of mammalian CARD8 orthologs and examination of variation among different human populations suggest that the increase in infectious-disease burden associated with larger animal groups (i.e., herds and colonies), and possibly human population expansion, may have naturally selected for loss of CARD8. We also find that the loss-of-function CARD8 allele shows a modest association with an increased risk of systemic inflammatory response syndrome in a small study (p = 0.05). Therefore, a by-product of the selected benefit of loss of CARD8 could be increased inflammatory diseases. These results demonstrate the utility of genome-wide cell-based association screens with microbes in the identification of naturally selected variants that can impact human health.},

Here we show that the three major classes of bactericidal antibiotics, regardless of drug-target interaction, stimulate the production of highly deleterious hydroxyl radicals in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, which ultimately contribute to cell death. We also show, in contrast, that bacteriostatic drugs do not produce hydroxyl radicals. We demonstrate that the mechanism of hydroxyl radical formation induced by bactericidal antibiotics is the end product of an oxidative damage cellular death pathway involving the tricarboxylic acid cycle, a transient depletion of NADH, destabilization of iron-sulfur clusters, and stimulation of the Fenton reaction. Our results suggest~that all three major classes of bactericidal drugs can be potentiated by targeting bacterial systems that remediate hydroxyl radical damage, including proteins involved in triggering the DNA damage response, e.g., RecA.},

  abstract = {Listeria monocytogenes causes listeriosis, a foodborne disease that poses serious risks to fetuses, newborns and immunocompromised adults. This intracellular bacterial pathogen proliferates in the host cytosol and exploits the host actin polymerization machinery to spread from cell-to-cell and disseminate in the host. Here, we report that during several days of infection in human hepatocytes or trophoblast cells, L. monocytogenes switches from this active motile lifestyle to a stage of persistence in vacuoles. Upon intercellular spread, bacteria gradually stopped producing the actin-nucleating protein ActA and became trapped in lysosome-like vacuoles termed Listeria-Containing Vacuoles (LisCVs). Subpopulations of bacteria resisted degradation in LisCVs and entered a slow/non-replicative state. During the subculture of host cells harboring LisCVs, bacteria showed a capacity to cycle between the vacuolar and the actin-based motility stages. When ActA was absent, such as in {$\Delta$}actA mutants, vacuolar bacteria parasitized host cells in the so-called ``viable but non-culturable'' state (VBNC), preventing their detection by conventional colony counting methods. The exposure of infected cells to high doses of gentamicin did not trigger the formation of LisCVs, but selected for vacuolar and VBNC bacteria. Together, these results reveal the ability of L. monocytogenes to enter a persistent state in a subset of epithelial cells, which may favor the asymptomatic carriage of this pathogen, lengthen the incubation period of listeriosis, and promote bacterial survival during antibiotic therapy.},

  abstract = {Microbial electrochemical techniques describe a variety of emerging technologies that use electrode\textendash bacteria interactions for biotechnology applications including the production of electricity, waste and wastewater treatment, bioremediation and the production of valuable products. Central in each application is the ability of the microbial catalyst to interact with external electron acceptors and/or donors and its metabolic properties that enable the combination of electron transport and carbon metabolism. And here also lies the key challenge. A wide range of microbes has been discovered to be able to exchange electrons with solid surfaces or mediators but only a few have been studied in depth. Especially electron transfer mechanisms from cathodes towards the microbial organism are poorly understood but are essential for many applications such as microbial electrosynthesis. We analyze the different electron transport chains that nature offers for organisms such as metal respiring bacteria and acetogens, but also standard biotechnological organisms currently used in bio-production. Special focus lies on the essential connection of redox and energy metabolism, which is often ignored when studying bioelectrochemical systems. The possibility of extracellular electron exchange at different points in each organism is discussed regarding required redox potentials and effect on cellular redox and energy levels. Key compounds such as electron carriers (e.g., cytochromes, ferredoxin, quinones, flavins) are identified and analyzed regarding their possible role in electrode\textendash microbe interactions. This work summarizes our current knowledge on electron transport processes and uses a theoretical approach to predict the impact of different modes of transfer on the energy metabolism. As such it adds an important piece of fundamental understanding of microbial electron transport possibilities to the research community and will help to optimize and advance bioelectrochemical techniques.},

Cellular invasion can be measured using standard techniques such as the classical gentamicin protection assay, based on the quantification of colony-forming units from lysates of infected cells. In addition, there are methods based on immunofluorescence microscopy which allow for assaying invasion in a medium- to high-throughput manner. In the following sections we detail two different assays that can be used alone or in combination to quantify the internalization of L. monocytogenes in host cells.},

Innate immunity consists of sensors or pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) that are expressed on immune and non-immune cells and sense conserved pathogen-derived molecules or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in various compartments of the host cells. Recognition of the PAMPs by PRRs triggers antimicrobial effector responses via the induction of proinflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs. Several families of PRRs, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), and DNA sensors and their respective PAMPs have been well studied in innate immunity and host defense. Here, we review the recent findings on bacterial recognition by TLRs and NLRs and the signaling pathways activated by these sensors.},

  abstract = {The two pathogenic Listeria species, L. ivanovii and L monocytogenes, can be differentiated biochemically and show different host ranges. Virulence of L. monocytogenes is dependent on the integrity of prfA which positively and coordinately regulates transcription of several virulence genes. Until now, a prfA homologue had not been identified in L. ivanovii. We have now cloned a chromosomal region from L. ivanovii comprising two genes with high homology to the picA and prfA genes from L. monocytogenes. Distal from prfA, an open reading frame highly homologous to a phosphorlbosyl pyrophosphate synthetase gene (prs) was newly identified, defining the border of the virulence gene cluster. Transcription of the gene for ivanolysin O and expression of other genes of the virulence gene cluster in L. ivanovii were dependent on PrfA. The pattern of PrfA-dependent proteins (PdPs) expressed in L ivanovii was similar, but not identical to that of L. monocytogenes. The PrfA proteins, as predicted from nucleotide sequences of both pathogenic Listeria species, are very similar and show significant homology to the Crp-Fnr family of global transcription regulators.},

  abstract = {Protoplasts of Bacillus subtilis plated on SDG medium formed L colonies in quantative yield and propagated in the L-form indefinitely. Protoplasts or L bodies placed in 25\% gelatin medium formed bacillary colonies. Details of the reversion of these naked bodies to the walled form are reported here. Protoplasts prepared in minimal medium reverted fairly synchronously 3 to 4 hr after inoculation into gelatin, but protoplasts preincubated in casein hydrolysate (CH)-enriched minimal medium were primed to revert within 1 hr in the gelatin. Preincubation for 1.5 hr in 0.44\% CH was required for good priming. Cells must be subjected to this preincubation (step 1) in the naked state; it is effective for L bodies as well as protoplasts. Priming was blocked by chloramphenicol, puromycin, and actinomycin D but was not affected by penicillin, lysozyme, or inhibition of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis. It is concluded that protein and ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis are required during step 1, that DNA synthesis is not required, and that wall mucopeptide is not made. The reversion of well-primed protoplasts in the gelatin (step 2) proceeded undisturbed in thymine-starved cells with chromosomes arrested at the terminus. It was scarcely slowed by chloramphenicol in the gelatin but was delayed about 3 hr by both puromycin and actinomycin D. Escape from inhibition occurred while the inhibitors were still actively blocking growth. Penicillin and cycloserine inhibited and lysozyme reversed reversion. Momentary melting of the gelatin delayed reversion. It is concluded that mucopeptide synthesis occurs in step 2, that concomitant RNA, DNA, or protein synthesis is not essential, but that physical immobilization of excreted cell products at the protoplast surface is necessary early in step 2. Newly reverted cells were misshapen and osmotically sensitive. Processes which confer osmotic stability after reversion (step 3) did not occur in the presence of chloramphenicol or actinomycin D.},

  abstract = {Vitrification of aqueous solutions is a prerequisite for cryo- electron microscopy and cryo- electron tomography, and therefore forms the basis for a significant area of modern structural biology. Theoretical and technical considerations mean that structural studies of macromolecules and viruses have excelled, whereas studies of eukaryotic cell biology and hydrogels have been limited. Vitrification has nevertheless had a significant impact in the freeze-substitution methods that have helped to eliminate the artifacts caused by chemical fixation. These methods are more amenable to studies of thicker specimens including hydrogels, and are generally regarded as superior to classical methods. The combination of vitrification and focused ion beam milling has opened up opportunities for exploring cells in their (frozen-)hydrated state. This chapter describes vitreous water, how it is prepared in practice, the physical limitations to this process, and examples of what we have learned since it became practical to prepare vitreous samples for electron microscopy.},

The shape and ultrastructure of the organisms varied with the osmolar concentration of the fixative. When the fixation mixture was hypertonic to the culture medium, ultrathin sections suggested that the cells had shrunk. Phosphate buffer, sodium chloride, or sucrose at comparable osmolaities had the same effect as sodium cacodylate. Glutaraldehyde itself also contributed to the osmotic effects of the fixation mixture but to a lesser extent than salts or sucrose, to which the cell membrane is impermeable. The osmolar concentration of the fixation mixture seemed of greater importance than pH in determining morphology. The mycoplasma was still susceptible to damage by high concentrations of cacodylate after fixation with 2.5\% glutaraldehyde. The best procedure was to fix and wash the organism under conditions isotonic with the growth medium. These conditions were also satisfactory for a filamentous mycoplasma, Mycoplasma orale.},

  abstract = {The investigation on antimicrobial mechanisms is a challenging and crucial issue in the fields of food or clinical microbiology, as it constitutes a prerequisite to the development of new antimicrobial processes or compounds, as well as to anticipate phenomenon of microbial resistance. Nowadays it is accepted that a cells population exposed to a stress can cause the appearance of different cell populations and in particular sub-lethally compromised cells which could be defined as viable but non-culturable (VBNC). Recent advances on flow cytometry (FCM) and especially on multi-parameter flow cytometry (MP-FCM) provide the opportunity to obtain high-speed information at real time on damage at single-cell level. This review gathers MP-FCM methodologies based on individual and simultaneous staining of microbial cells employed to investigate their physiological state following different physical and chemical antimicrobial treatments. Special attention will be paid to recent studies exploiting the possibility to corroborate MP-FCM results with additional techniques (plate counting, microscopy, spectroscopy, molecular biology techniques, membrane modeling) in order to elucidate the antimicrobial mechanism of action of a given antimicrobial treatment or compound. The combination of MP-FCM methodologies with these additional methods is namely a promising and increasingly used approach to give further insight in differences in microbial sub-population evolutions in response to antimicrobial treatments.},

  abstract = {The zebrafish, Danio rerio, has become a popular vertebrate model for the study of infections, mainly because of its excellent optical accessibility at the embryonic and larval stages, when the innate immune system is already effective. We have thus tested the susceptibility of zebrafish larvae to the human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, a gram-positive, facultative, intracellular bacterium that is known to survive and multiply in professional phagocytes and that causes fatal meningitis and abortions. Intravenous injection of early zebrafish larvae resulted in a progressive and ultimately fatal infection. Blood-borne L. monocytogenes bacteria were quickly trapped and engulfed by macrophages, an event that, for the first time, could be captured in vivo and in real time. Granulocytes also participated in the innate immune response. As in mammals, bacteria could escape the macrophage phagosome in a listeriolysin-dependent manner and accessed the cytosol; this event was critical for bacterial virulence, as listeriolysin-deficient bacteria were completely avirulent. Actin comet tails and protrusions were observed, suggesting cell-to-cell spread; these phenomena also played a role in virulence in zebrafish larvae, as actA-deficient bacteria were attenuated. These results demonstrate the relevance of the genetically tractable and optically accessible zebrafish model for the study of L. monocytogenes pathogenesis and particularly for the dissection of its interactions with phagocytes in vivo, a key factor of L. monocytogenes virulence.},

  abstract = {Twenty-five Listeria monocytogenes strains of various serotypes and sources, including clinical and food isolates associated with the same outbreaks, were characterized and compared based on growth rates and heat and acid death rates. Growth was monitored in tryptic soy broth supplemented with 0.6\% yeast extract (TSBYE) at 4 and 30\textdegree C for 32 days and 20 h, respectively. Heat and acid stress responses in TSBYE heated to 55\textdegree C or acidified to pH 3.0 with lactic acid were evaluated for 240 or 120 min, respectively. Extensive variation in growth and stress resistance was observed among the tested strains. Growth rate differences were less evident at 30 than at 4\textdegree C, where growth rates (log CFU per milliliter per day) ranged from 0.28 to 0.43. Thermal and acid death rates (log CFU per milliliter per minute) ranged from -0.023 to -0.052 and from -0.012 to -0.134, respectively. Serotype appeared to play a significant role (P {$<$} 0.05) only with respect to the heat resistance of the organism. Serotype 4b isolates as a group had lower heat resistance than did isolates representing all other serotypes combined. Although no clear origin-related (food versus clinical) trends were observed under the tested conditions, outbreak-related isolates of serotype 4b had lower acid death rates (higher acid resistance) (P {$<$} 0.05) than did the rest of the strains belonging to this serotype. Strain Scott A exhibited slow growth at 4\textdegree C and low acid resistance, behavior that was distinct among both clinical and serotype 4b isolates. The results of this study highlight the risks associated with extrapolation to other strains of findings obtained with only one strain of L. monocytogenes. This information should be useful when test strains are to be selected for the evaluation of antimicrobial alternatives in ready-to-eat meat and other food products and when risk assessments are to be conducted.},

  abstract = {Purpose c-Met is overexpressed in some non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines and tissues. Cell lines with higher levels of c-Met expression and phosphorylation depend on this receptor for survival. We studied the effects of AMG-458 on 2 NSCLC cell lines. Methods and Materials 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium assays assessed the sensitivities of the cells to AMG-458. Clonogenic survival assays illustrated the radiosensitizing effects of AMG-458. Western blot for cleaved caspase 3 measured apoptosis. Immunoblotting for c-Met, phospho-Met (p-Met), Akt/p-Akt, and Erk/p-Erk was performed to observe downstream signaling. Results AMG-458 enhanced radiosensitivity in H441 but not in A549. H441 showed constitutive phosphorylation of c-Met. A549 expressed low levels of c-Met, which were phosphorylated only in the presence of exogenous hepatocyte growth factor. The combination of radiation therapy and AMG-458 treatment was found to synergistically increase apoptosis in the H441 cell line but not in A549. Radiation therapy, AMG-458, and combination treatment were found to reduce p-Akt and p-Erk levels in H441 but not in A549. H441 became less sensitive to AMG-458 after small interfering RNA knockdown of c-Met; there was no change in A549. After overexpression of c-Met, A549 became more sensitive, while H441 became less sensitive to AMG-458. Conclusions AMG-458 was more effective in cells that expressed higher levels of c-Met/p-Met, suggesting that higher levels of c-Met and p-Met in NSCLC tissue may classify a subset of tumors that are more sensitive to molecular therapies against this receptor.},

It was functionally expressed, and the BlsTs construct yielded the highest enzyme activity (12.1~U/mL). Furthermore, the effect of different cultural conditions on the inducible expression of BlsTs was investigated, and the optimal condition was as follows: 4\% maltodextrin, 0.4\% soybean powder, 1\% xylose added after 10~h of growth and an induction time of 12~h at 37~\textdegree C.

When these vectors are used to construct transcriptional fusions, the subsequent cleavage of the hybrid mRNA at the RNaseIII site generates an unchanging 5' end for the lacZ mRNA. In contrast to earlier vectors, this feature helps to ensure independent translation of the lacZ mRNA and, thus, the level of beta-galactosidase produced should accurately reflect the frequency of transcription of the upstream DNA sequences. Additional modifications of the vectors include removal of a weak transcriptional terminator between the cloning site and lacZ, insertion of a terminator downstream of lac, and alteration of restriction endonuclease cleavage sites to facilitate the in vitro construction of fusions. Both multicopy plasmid (pTL61T) and single-copy lambda (lambda TL61) vectors have been assembled. These vectors should be generally useful in scanning for transcriptional regulatory signals.},

However, the molecular mechanism of the pathogenesis is not fundamentally assessed. This study aimed to analyze the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in L. monocytogenes during its invasion into glia cells. The ROS level in L. monocytogenes was manipulated using NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI) and ROS scavenger N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). Results showed that the invasiveness of L. monocytogenes was elevated when ROS was downregulated by DPI and NAC treatment. Expression profiles of proinflammatory factors in glia cells were also examined because they play important roles in the functions of glia cells in the brain immune system. The expression levels of proinflammatory factors (tumor necrosis factor {$\alpha$} and interleukin-1{$\beta$}) in host glia cells were downregulated when invaded by L. monocytogenes with lower ROS level. This finding indicates that ROS may function as negative regulator during the invasion of L. monocytogenes in brain infection.},

  abstract = {Cerebrovascular accumulation of amyloid-{$\beta$} (A{$\beta$}) peptides in Alzheimer's disease (AD) may contribute to disease progression through A{$\beta$}-induced microvascular endothelial pathogenesis. Pinocembrin has been shown to have therapeutic effects in AD models. These effects correlate with preservation of microvascular function, but the effect on endothelial cells under A{$\beta$}-damaged conditions is unclear. The present study focuses on the in vitro protective effect of pinocembrin on fibrillar A{$\beta$}1-40 (fA{$\beta$}1-40) injured human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs) and explores potential mechanisms. The results demonstrate that fA{$\beta$}1-40-induced cytotoxicity in hBMECs can be rescued by pinocembrin treatment. Pinocembrin increases cell viability, reduces the release of LDH, and relieves nuclear condensation. The mechanisms of this reversal from A{$\beta$} may be associated with the inhibition of inflammatory response, involving inhibition of MAPK activation, downregulation of phosphor-IKK level, relief of I{$\kappa$}B{$\alpha$} degradation, blockage of NF-{$\kappa$}B p65 nuclear translocation, and reduction of the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Pinocembrin does not show obvious effects on regulating the redox imbalance after exposure to fA{$\beta$}1-40. Together, the suppression of MAPK and the NF-{$\kappa$}B signaling pathways play a significant role in the anti-inflammation of pinocembrin in hBMECs subjected to fA{$\beta$}1-40. This may serve as a therapeutic agent for BMEC protection in Alzheimer's-related deficits.},

  abstract = {Generation and characterization of transgenic mice are important elements of biomedical research. In recent years, transgenic technology has become more versatile and sophisticated, mainly because of the incorporation of recombinase-mediated conditional expression and targeted insertion, site-specific endonuclease-mediated genome editing, siRNA-mediated gene knockdown, various inducible gene expression systems, and fluorescent protein marking and tracking techniques. Site-specific recombinases (such as PhiC31) and engineered endonucleases (such as ZFN and Talen) have significantly enhanced our ability to target transgenes into specific genomic loci, but currently a great majority of transgenic mouse lines are continuingly being created using the conventional random insertion method. A major challenge for using this conventional method is that the genomic environment at the integration site has a substantial influence on the expression of the transgene. Although our understanding of such chromosomal position effects and our means to combat them are still primitive, adhering to some general guidelines can significantly increase the odds of successful transgene expression. This chapter first discusses the major problems associated with transgene expression, and then describes some of the principles for using plasmid and bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) for generating transgenic constructs. Finally, the strategies for conducting each of the major types of transgenic research are discussed, including gene overexpression, promoter characterization, cell-lineage tracing, mutant complementation, expression of double or multiple transgenes, siRNA knockdown, and conditional and inducible systems.},

  abstract = {The prion protein (PrP) plays a key role in prion disease pathogenesis. Although the misfolded and pathologic variant of this protein (PrP(SC)) has been studied in depth, the physiological role of PrP(C) remains elusive and controversial. PrP(C) is a cell-surface glycoprotein involved in multiple cellular functions at the plasma membrane, where it interacts with a myriad of partners and regulates several intracellular signal transduction cascades. However, little is known about the gene expression changes modulated by PrP(C) in animals and in cellular models. In this article, we present PrP(C)-dependent gene expression signature in N2a cells and its implication in the most overrepresented functions: cell cycle, cell growth and proliferation, and maintenance of cell shape. PrP(C) over-expression enhances cell proliferation and cell cycle re-entrance after serum stimulation, while PrP(C) silencing slows down cell cycle progression. In addition, MAP kinase and protein kinase B (AKT) pathway activation are under the regulation of PrP(C) in asynchronous cells and following mitogenic stimulation. These effects are due in part to the modulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by PrP(C) in the plasma membrane, where the two proteins interact in a multimeric complex. We also describe how PrP(C) over-expression modulates filopodia formation by Rho GTPase regulation mainly in an AKT-Cdc42-N-WASP-dependent pathway.},

We constructed a Mycoplasma genitalium ftsZ null mutant by gene replacement to investigate the role of this gene and the presence of alternative cell division mechanisms in this minimal bacterium. Our results demonstrate that ftsZ is non-essential for cell growth and reveal that, in the absence of the FtsZ protein, M. genitalium can manage feasible cell divisions and cytokinesis using the force generated by its motile machinery. This is an alternative mechanism, completely independent of the FtsZ protein, to perform cell division by binary fission in a microorganism. We also propose that the mycoplasma cytoskeleton, a complex network of proteins involved in many aspects of the biology of these microorganisms, may have taken over the function of many genes involved in cell division, allowing their loss in the regressive evolution of the streamlined mycoplasma genomes.},

  abstract = {A511::luxAB is a recombinant derivative of a broad-host-range bacteriophage specific for the genus Listeria, transducing bacterial bioluminescence into infected cells. In this study, we have evaluated its use for rapid and easy testing of contaminated foods and environmental samples for the presence of viable Listeria cells, in comparison to the standard plating procedure. With a short preenrichment step of 20 h, the system was capable of detecting very low initial contamination rates in several foods artificially contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes Scott A cells. In ricotta cheese, chocolate pudding, and cabbage, less than one cell per g of food could be clearly identified by comparing the light emission of phage-infected samples to that of controls without lux phage. In foods having a large and complex microbial background flora, such as minced meat and soft cheese, at least 10 cells per g were necessary to produce a positive bioluminescence signal. Of 348 potentially contaminated natural food and environmental samples, 55 were found to be Listeria positive by the lux phage method. The standard plating procedure detected 57 positive samples. Some differences were observed with respect to the individual samples, i.e., the lux phage procedure detected more positive samples among the dairy products and environmental samples, whereas the plating procedure revealed more contaminated meat and poultry samples. Overall, both methods performed similarly, i.e., were equally sensitive. However, the minimum time required for detection of Listeria with the luciferase phage assay was 24 h, which is much shorter than the 4 days needed by the standard plating method. Furthermore, a most probable number technique with three parallels, based on the use of A511::luxAB for differentiation of positive and negative tubes, is described. The method enables rapid enumeration of low levels of Listeria cells in several foods tested, against the background of a competing microflora.},

  abstract = {Listeria monocytogenes bacteriophages A118, A500 and A511 are members of three distinct phage groups with characteristic host ranges. Their endolysin (ply) genes were colonies and expressed in Escherichia coli as demonstrated by the conferred lytic phenotype when colonies of recombinant cells were overlaid with a lawn of Listeria ceils. The nucleotide sequences of the cloned DNA fragments were determined and the individual enzymes (PLY118, 30.8 kDa; PLY500, 33.4 kDa; PLY511, 36.5 kDa) were shown to have varying degrees of homology within their N-terminal or C-terminal domains. Transcriptional analysis revealed them to be`late'genes with transcription beginning 15\textendash 20 min post-infection. The enzymes were over-expressed and partially purified and their individual specificities examined. When applied exogenously, the lysins induced rapid lysis of Listeria strains from all species but generally did not affect other bacteria. Using hydrolysis of purified listerial cell walls, PLY511 was characterized as an N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase (EC 3.5.1.28) and shows homology in its N-terminal domain to other enzymes of this type. In contrast, PLY118 and PLY500 were shown to represent a new class of cell wall lytic enzymes which cleave between the L-alanine and D-glutamate residues of listerial peptidoglycan; these were designated as L-alanoyl-D-glutamate peptidases. These two enzymes share homology in the N-terminal domain which we propose determines hydrolytic specificity. Highly conserved holin (hol) gene sequences are present upstream of ply118 and ply500. They encode proteins of structural similarity to the product of phage lambda gene S, and are predicted to be membrane proteins which form pores to allow access of the lysins to their peptidoglycan substrates. This arrangement of conserved holin genes with downstream lysin genes among the siphoviral lysis cassettes explains why the cytoplasmic endolysins alone are not lethal, since they require a specific transport function across the cell membrane.},

Each of these enzyme engineering platforms relies on compartmentalization of reaction components, similar to microtiter plate-based assays which have been commonly used for testing the activity of enzyme variants. The technologies can be broadly divided into three categories according to their spatial segregation strategy: (1) cells as reaction compartments, (2) in vitro compartmentalization via synthetic droplets, and (3) microchambers. Here, we discuss these emerging platforms, which in some cases enable the screening of greater than 10 million enzyme variants, and highlight benefits and limitations of each technology.},

Prognosis could be correlated with initial cerebrospinal fluid glucose values; a reduced glucose value was an ominous prognostic sign. Disk susceptibility tests showed that several antibiotics inhibited Listeria monocytogenes growth in vitro. Despite appropriate therapy, 5 of 18 died; and those who recovered sometimes improved only slowly. The unpredictability of in vitro susceptibilities indicates the need for guiding therapy by the results of in vitro sensitivity tests. Animal experiments showed that Listeria monocytogenes often persisted i n mouse tissues despite penicillin or tetracycline therapy. There was no evidence that persistence of experimental infections was related to "L"-form transformation. It would appear that Listeria monocytogenes can be added to the growing list of organisms that cause secondary infection in those whose defenses are impaired by lymphatic malignancy.},

  abstract = {Macrophages are versatile cells of the immune system which react to various external stimuli through different polarization patterns which adjust the cells to the required function whether it is removal of pathogens or necrotic cells, tissue repair or propagation of inflammation. As much of macrophage behavior is determined by their polarization, appropriate models to study macrophage polarization are required. Previously we have published a protocol for transfection of THP-1 macrophages, which in brief pre-differentiates THP-1 monocytes for 48 h using 100 ng/ml PMA, followed by detachment of the cells and eletroporation using Lonza nucleofector technology and finally includes further 48 h of differentiation with 100 ng/ml PMA. When we applied this protocol to study interleukin (IL) 10 dependent polarization, the cells were inert to the IL10 stimulus, as indicated by a failure to induce IL10 target genes such as SOCS3. Further investigation revealed that the cells were classically activated by the differentiation agent phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) as shown by induction of chemokine receptor CCR7. Subsequent reduction of PMA concentration during THP-1 macrophage differentiation significantly improved their response to IL10 as SOCS3 increased more than 40-fold. This increased responsiveness of the THP-1 macrophages was also confirmed for polarization with LPS and IFN{$\gamma$}. Up-regulation of classical activation markers CCL3, CCR7 and TNF{$\alpha$} was enhanced from 18-, 21- and 70-fold, respectively, to 48-, 222- and 951-fold, respectively. Reduction of PMA concentration did not negatively affect macrophage differentiation or transfection efficiency. Expression of macrophage differentiation markers CD11b and CD68 as well as cell morphology remained unchanged. In addition transfection efficiency and rates of apoptosis and necrosis remained unaffected. Thus our revised protocol combines high transfection efficiency and cell vitality with a strong response to polarizing stimuli and therefore constitutes a suitable model for studying macrophage polarization in vitro.},

The parental bacterial forms (S-forms) were isolated up to 7 days after challenge from the peritoneal cavity and the liver, while the L-forms were isolated up to 60 days from the peritoneal cavity. Continuous adhesion of L-forms on the peritoneal macrophage surface was found by scanning-electron microscopy. Erythrocyte and leucocyte count as well as some clinical chemistry parameters were measured during infections. They showed different dynamics in the three experimental groups. Histomorphological changes in the liver (microabscesses and mononuclear cellular granulomas) of infected animals were observed. They were less intensive and appeared later in rats infected with L-forms. The experiments demonstrated that infections caused by parental bacterial forms and by combined inoculum took an acute course, while the infection caused by L-forms could be distinguished as a prolonged and persistent one.},

  abstract = {Our previous studies showed that mycobacterial L-forms persist in the blood of BCG vaccinated people and that BCG vaccine is able to produce, under appropriate conditions, filterable, self-replicating L-bodies with virus-like size. Because filterability is one of the characteristics of L-forms, considerable interest has been shown in their capacity to cross the maternal-fetal barrier. The current study demonstrated isolation of mycobacterial L-form cultures from umbilical cord blood of five healthy newborns of healthy mothers vaccinated previously with BCG. The isolated cultures showed distinctive growth characteristics of cell wall deficient L-form bacteria. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated presence of L-bodies with extremely small size of 100~nm and revealed morphological transformations, typical for L-forms. IS6110 Real Time PCR assay confirmed that all L-form isolates were of mycobacterial origin and belonged to Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex which includes vaccinal BCG substrains. In conclusion, we could suggest that reproductive filterable L-bodies of BCG origin are able to fall in blood circulation of the fetus by vertical transmitted pathway and colonize newborns.},

  abstract = {Possible persistence of bacteria in human blood as cell wall deficient forms (L-forms) represents a top research priority for microbiologists. Application of live BCG vaccine and L-form transformation of vaccine strain may display a new intriguing aspect concerning the opportunity for occurrence of unpredictable colonization inside the human body by unusual microbial life forms. L-form cultures were isolated from 141 blood samples of people previously vaccinated with BCG, none with a history of exposure to tuberculosis. Innovative methodology to access the unusual L-form elements derived from human blood was developed. The methodology outlines the path of transformation of non- cultivable L-form element to cultivable bacteria and their adaptation for growth in vitro. All isolates showed typical L-forms growth features (``fried eggs'' colonies and biofilm). Electron microscopy revealed morphology evidencing peculiar characteristics of bacterial L-form population (cell wall deficient polymorphic elements of variable shape and size). Regular detection of acid fast bacteria in smears of isolated blood L-form cultures, led us to start their identification by using specific Mycobactrium spp. genetic tests. Forty five of 97 genetically tested blood cultures provided specific positive signals for mycobacteria, confirmed by at least one of the three specific assays (16S rRNA PCR; IS6110 Real Time PCR and spoligotyping). In conclusion, the obtained genetic evidence suggests that these L-forms are of mycobacterial origin. As the investigated people had been vaccinated with BCG, we can assume that the identified mycobacterial L-forms may be produced by persisting live BCG vaccine.},

Light and transmission electron microscopy demonstrated conversion from classical rod to polymorphic L-form shape morphology and atypical growths of E. coli. Microcrystal formations observed at this stage were interpreted as being closely linked to the processes of L-form conversion and probably involved in the general phenomenon of protection against lethal environment. Identity of the morphologically modified L-forms as E. coli was verified by species specific DNA-based test. Our study might contribute to a better understanding of the L-form phenomenon and its importance for bacterial survival, as well as provoke reexamination of the traditional view of killing strategies against bacteria.},

  abstract = {Cyclic di-AMP (c-di-AMP) is an essential and ubiquitous second messenger among bacteria. c-di-AMP regulates many cellular pathways through direct binding to several molecular targets in bacterial cells. c-di-AMP depletion is well known to destabilize the bacterial cell wall, resulting in increased bacteriolysis and enhanced susceptibility to cell wall targeting antibiotics. Using the human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes as a model, we found that c-di-AMP accumulation also impaired cell envelope integrity. An L. monocytogenes mutant deleted for c-di-AMP phosphodiesterases (pdeA pgpH mutant) exhibited a 4-fold increase in c-di-AMP levels and several cell wall defects. For instance, the pdeA pgpH mutant was defective for the synthesis of peptidoglycan muropeptides and was susceptible to cell walltargeting antimicrobials. Among different muropeptide precursors, we found that the pdeA pgpH strain was particularly impaired in the synthesis of D-Ala\textendash D-Ala, which is required to complete the pentapeptide stem associated with UDP\textendash N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc). This was consistent with an increased sensitivity to D-cycloserine, which inhibits the D-alanine branch of peptidoglycan synthesis. Finally, upon examining D-Ala:D-Ala ligase (Ddl), which catalyzes the conversion of D-Ala to D-Ala\textendash D-Ala, we found that its activity was activated by Kϩ. Based on previous reports that c-di-AMP inhibits Kϩ uptake, we propose that c-di-AMP accumulation impairs peptidoglycan synthesis, partially through the deprivation of cytoplasmic Kϩ levels, which are required for cell wallsynthetic enzymes.},

  abstract = {While temperature-dependent induction of flagella is a well-characterized phenomenon in Listeria monocytogenes, the essentiality of increased flagellum production during growth at low temperatures remains unclear. To study this relationship, we compared the relative expression levels of two motility genes, flhA and motA, at 3\textdegree C, 25\textdegree C and 37\textdegree C in L. monocytogenes strain EGD-e by using qRT-PCR, and compared the growth curves, motility, and flagellation between the wild-type and flhA and motA deletion mutants. The relative expression levels of flhA and motA at 3\textdegree C were significantly higher than at 37\textdegree C (p{$<$}0.01). At 3\textdegree C, the level of flhA transcripts was also significantly higher than at 25\textdegree C (p{$<$}0.01). Growth curve analysis showed that at 3\textdegree C both the growth rates and maximum optical densities of {$\Delta$}flhA and {$\Delta$}motA strains at 600nm were significantly lower than those of the wild-type (p{$<$}0.001), while no significant differences were observed between the wild-type and the mutants at 37\textdegree C, and 25\textdegree C. Mutant strains {$\Delta$}flhA and {$\Delta$}motA were nonmotile at all three temperatures. At 25\textdegree C, the number of flagellated cells of {$\Delta$}motA was notably reduced compared with the wild-type, whereas {$\Delta$}flhA appeared nonflagellated at all temperatures. The results suggest that flhA and motA play a role in the cold tolerance of L. monocytogenes strain EGD-e, and that motile flagella may be needed for optimal cold stress response of L. monocytogenes.},

For many idiopathic diseases, the causes become clear when certain techniques are applied to the patient's blood or other tissues. Cell Wall Deficient Forms: Stealth Pathogens, Third Edition describes these techniques. In the case of tuberculosis, a disease that has recently regained importance because the strains have acquired antibiotic resistance, the book describes a method that is widely used abroad. This method typically renders the diagnosis within 72 hours. The book examines a plethora of issues and provides answers to the following questions:What organism should be added to the childhood vaccine, especially for boys?What bacteria in its pleomorphic state is found in direct smears of synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis cases?In which chronic diseases ( presently considered as being of unknown origin) is an acid-fast organism routinely found in smears of 72 hour blood cultures?Which "bacterium" has a life cycle in the human erythrocyte as complex as that of Plasmodium malaria?Which common pathogen's L Form can permanently damage myocardium mammaliam?

Each of these organisms is difficult to fix for EM by conventional methods that use buffered fixatives at room temperature because they each have formidable diffusion barriers that hinder the free exchange of reagents. However, when low-temperature fixation methods, such as high-pressure freezing (HPF) and freeze-substitution are used, the preservation of cellular ultrastructure can be excellent. The chapter discusses the basic equipment for HPF and the way to use it and explains the use of frozen material to prepare it for routine EM analysis, cellular tomography, or EM immunolabeling. HPF works by lowering the freezing point and suppressing the rate of ice crystal nucleation and growth. This follows from the fact that the volume of water increases as it crystallizes. The rapid application of a high hydrostatic pressure inhibits this expansion, slowing the crystallization that occurs with cooling and letting the water become immobilized in a vitreous state before crystals can form.},

Cellular Electron Microscopy will help biologists from many disciplines understand modern EM and the value it might bring to their own work. The book's five sections deal with all major issues in EM of cells: specimen preparation, imaging in 3-D, imaging and understanding frozen-hydrated samples, labeling macromolecules, and analyzing EM data. Each chapter was written by scientists who are among the best in their field, and some chapters provide multiple points of view on the issues they discuss. Each section of the book is preceded by an introduction, which should help newcomers understand the subject. The book shows why many biologists believe that modern EM will forge the link between light microscopy of live cells and atomic resolution studies of isolated macromolecules, helping us toward the goal of an atomic resolution understanding of living systems.Updates the numerous technological innovations that have improved the capabilities of electron microscopyProvides timely coverage of the subject given the significant rise in the number of biologists using light microscopy to answer their questions and the natural limitations of this kind of imagingChapters include a balance of "how to", "so what" and "where next", providing the reader with both practical information, which is necessary to use these methods, and a sense of where the field is going},

Here we report that, in Bacillus subtilis, this complex is functional in the absence of all known peptidoglycan polymerases. Cells lacking these enzymes survive by inducing an envelope stress response that increases the expression of RodA, a widely conserved core component of the Rod complex. RodA is a member of the SEDS (shape, elongation, division and sporulation) family of proteins, which have essential but ill-defined roles in cell wall biogenesis during growth, division and sporulation. Our genetic and biochemical analyses indicate that SEDS proteins constitute a family of peptidoglycan polymerases. Thus, B. subtilis and probably most bacteria use two distinct classes of polymerase to synthesize their exoskeleton. Our findings indicate that SEDS family proteins are core cell wall synthases of the cell elongation and division machinery, and represent attractive targets for antibiotic development.},

  abstract = {Certain intracellular bacteria use the host cell cytosol as the replicative niche. Although it has been hypothesized that the successful exploitation of this compartment requires a unique metabolic adaptation, supportive evidence is lacking. For Francisella tularensis, many genes of the Francisella pathogenicity island (FPI) are essential for intracellular growth, and therefore, FPI mutants are useful tools for understanding the prerequisites of intracytosolic replication. We compared the growth of bacteria taken up by phagocytic or nonphagocytic cells with that of bacteria microinjected directly into the host cytosol, using the live vaccine strain (LVS) of F. tularensis; five selected FPI mutants thereof, i.e., {$\Delta$}iglA, {$\Delta$}igl\c{C} {$\Delta$}iglG, {$\Delta$}iglI, and {$\Delta$}pdpE strains; and Listeria monocytogenes. After uptake in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM), ASC-/- BMDM, MyD88-/- BMDM, J774 cells, or HeLa cells, LVS, {$\Delta$}pdpE and {$\Delta$}iglG mutants, and L. monocytogenes replicated efficiently in all five cell types, whereas the {$\Delta$}iglA and {$\Delta$}iglC mutants showed no replication. After microinjection, all 7 strains showed effective replication in J774 macrophages, ASC-/- BMDM, and HeLa cells. In contrast to the rapid replication in other cell types, L. monocytogenes showed no replication in MyD88-/- BMDM and LVS showed no replication in either BMDM or MyD88-/- BMDM after microinjection. Our data suggest that the mechanisms of bacterial uptake as well as the permissiveness of the cytosolic compartment per se are important factors for the intracytosolic replication. Notably, none of the investigated FPI proteins was found to be essential for intracytosolic replication after microinjection.},

  abstract = {Adherence of pathogenic microorganisms to the cell surface is a key event during infection. We have previously reported the characterization of Listeria monocytogenes transposon mutants defective in adhesion to eukaryotic cells. One of these mutants had lost the ability to produce Ami, a 102~kDa autolytic amidase with an N-terminal catalytic domain and a C-terminal cell wall-anchoring domain made up of repeated modules containing the dipeptide GW (`GW modules'). We generated ami null mutations by plasmid insertion into L. monocytogenes strains lacking the invasion proteins InlA (EGD{$\Delta$}inlA), InlB (EGD{$\Delta$}inlB) or both (EGD{$\Delta$}inlAB). These mutants were 5\textendash 10 times less adherent than their parental strains in various cell types. The adhesion capacity of the mutants was restored by complementation with a DNA fragment encoding the Ami cell wall-anchoring domain fused to the Ami signal peptide. The cell-binding activity of the Ami cell wall-anchoring domain was further demonstrated using the purified polypeptide. Growth of the ami null mutants constructed in EGD and EGD{$\Delta$}inlAB backgrounds was attenuated in the livers of mice inoculated intravenously, indicating a role for Ami in L. monocytogenes virulence. Adhesive properties have recently been reported in the non-catalytic domain of two other autolysins, Staphylococcus epidermidis AtlE and Staphylococcus saprophyticus Aas. Interestingly, we found that these domains were also composed of repeated GW modules. Thus, certain autolysins appear to promote bacterial attachment by means of their GW repeat domains. These molecules may contribute to the colonization of host tissues by Gram-positive bacteria.},

  abstract = {Listeria monocytogenes infections have been frequently reported in many food poisoning outbreaks around the world. In this work, the protein repertoires of L. monocytogenes ATCC 7644 cells treated or not with a 10- 3 mg/mL nisin sublethal concentration, established by antimicrobial susceptibility tests, were analyzed by LC\textendash MS/MS. Overall, 179 proteins were identified, 9 of them more abundant in nisin-treated samples, and 4 more abundant in non-treated control samples. In nisin treated cells, proteins associated to oxidative stress response showed higher abundance. Also, the higher abundance of an enzyme related to the production of cell membrane lipids upon nisin exposure is suggestive of both a failure in conventional cell division mechanism and the activation of an alternative L-form mediated division mechanism. Finally, flagellar and motility proteins' overexpression upon nisin exposure is indicative of increased bacterial motility in response to the bacteriocin. Taken together, these results provide new insights on nisin effects on L. monocytogenes cells and on how this bacterium may overcome a bacteriocin-containing environment. Biological significance The antimicrobial mechanism of nisin on target bacterial cells has been extensively studied since discovery of this bacteriocin. The nisin pore-forming mechanism is mediated by its binding to the pyrophosphate portion of membrane lipid II [1], but some evidences point out to alternative mechanisms. Results from assays with mutacin 1140 hybrids [2] showed that the portion of nisin that is not involved with lipid II binding could damage the bacterial cell, independently of pore formation [3,4]. Moreover, there are insufficient data to explain how nisin affects the bacterial survival. In this scenario, proteomics is an interesting approach, as a comparison between treated and untreated cells may provide insights of both antimicrobial mechanisms of action and bacterial response mechanisms [5].},

  abstract = {Cells contain molecules, which become fluorescent when excited by UV/Vis radiation of suitable wavelength. This fluorescence emission, arising from endogenous fluorophores, is an intrinsic property of cells and is called auto-fluorescence to be distinguished from fluorescent signals obtained by adding exogenous markers. The majority of cell auto-fluorescence originates from mitochondria and lysosomes. Together with aromatic amino acids and lipo-pigments, the most important endogenous fluorophores are pyridinic (NADPH) and flavin coenzymes. In tissues, the extracellular matrix often contributes to the auto-fluorescence emission more than the cellular component, because collagen and elastin have, among the endogenous fluorophores, a relatively high quantum yield. Changes occurring in the cell and tissue state during physiological and/or pathological processes result in modifications of the amount and distribution of endogenous fluorophores and chemical\textendash physical properties of their microenvironment. Therefore, analytical techniques based on auto-fluorescence monitoring can be utilized in order to obtain information about morphological and physiological state of cells and tissues. Moreover, auto-fluorescence analysis can be performed in real time because it does not require any treatment of fixing or staining of the specimens. In the past few years spectroscopic and imaging techniques have been developed for many different applications both in basic research and diagnostics.},

  abstract = {We describe the development of genetic tools for regulated gene expression, the introduction of chromosomal mutations, and improved plasmid transfer by electroporation in the food-borne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. pIMK, a kanamycin-resistant, site-specific, integrative listeriophage vector was constructed and then modified for overexpression (pIMK2) or for isopropyl-{$\beta$}-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-regulated expression (pIMK3 and pIMK4). The dynamic range of promoters was assessed by determining luciferase activity, P60 secretion, and internalin A-mediated invasion. These analyses demonstrated that pIMK4 and pIMK3 have a stringently controlled dynamic range of 540-fold. Stable gene overexpression was achieved with pIMK2, giving a range of expression for the three vectors of 1,350-fold. The lactococcal pORI280 system was optimized for the generation of chromosomal mutations and used to create five new prfA star mutants. The combination of pIMK4 and pORI280 allowed streamlined creation of ``IPTG-dependent'' mutants. This was exemplified by creation of a clean deletion mutant with deletion of the universally essential secA gene, and this mutant exhibited a rapid loss of viability upon withdrawal of IPTG. We also improved plasmid transfer by electroporation into three commonly used laboratory strains of L. monocytogenes. A 125-fold increase in transformation efficiency for EGDe compared with the widely used protocol of Park and Stewart (S. F. Park and G. S. Stewart, Gene 94:129-132, 1990) was observed. Maximal transformation efficiencies of 5.7 \texttimes{} 106 and 6.7 \texttimes{} 106 CFU per {$\mu$}g were achieved for EGDe and 10403S, respectively, with a replicating plasmid. An efficiency of 2 \texttimes{} 107 CFU per {$\mu$}g is the highest efficiency reported thus far for L. monocytogenes F2365.},

  abstract = {FtsZ, a bacterial tubulin homologue, is a cytoskeletal protein that assembles into protofilaments that are one subunit thick. These protofilaments assemble further to form a ``Z ring'' at the center of prokaryotic cells. The Z ring generates a constriction force on the inner membrane and also serves as a scaffold to recruit cell wall remodeling proteins for complete cell division in vivo. One model of the Z ring proposes that protofilaments associate via lateral bonds to form ribbons; however, lateral bonds are still only hypothetical. To explore potential lateral bonding sites, we probed the surface of Escherichia coli FtsZ by inserting either small peptides or whole fluorescent proteins (FPs). Among the four lateral surfaces on FtsZ protofilaments, we obtained inserts on the front and back surfaces that were functional for cell division. We concluded that these faces are not sites of essential interactions. Inserts at two sites, G124 and R174, located on the left and right surfaces, completely blocked function, and these sites were identified as possible sites for essential lateral interactions. However, the insert at R174 did not interfere with association of protofilaments into sheets and bundles in vitro. Another goal was to find a location within FtsZ that supported insertion of FP reporter proteins while allowing the FtsZ-FPs to function as the sole source of FtsZ. We discovered one internal site, G55-Q56, where several different FPs could be inserted without impairing function. These FtsZ-FPs may provide advances for imaging Z-ring structure by superresolution techniques. IMPORTANCE One model for the Z-ring structure proposes that protofilaments are assembled into ribbons by lateral bonds between FtsZ subunits. Our study excluded the involvement of the front and back faces of the protofilament in essential interactions in vivo but pointed to two potential lateral bond sites, on the right and left sides. We also identified an FtsZ loop where various fluorescent proteins could be inserted without blocking function; these FtsZ-FPs functioned as the sole source of FtsZ. This advance provides improved tools for all fluorescence imaging of the Z ring and may be especially important for superresolution imaging.},

However, the role of bacterial autophagy in vivo remains poorly understood. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has emerged as a vertebrate model for the study of infections because it is optically accessible at the larval stages when the innate immune system is already functional. Here, we have characterized the susceptibility of zebrafish larvae to Shigella flexneri, a paradigm for bacterial autophagy, and have used this model to study Shigella-phagocyte interactions in vivo. Depending on the dose, S. flexneri injected in zebrafish larvae were either cleared in a few days or resulted in a progressive and ultimately fatal infection. Using high resolution live imaging, we found that S. flexneri were rapidly engulfed by macrophages and neutrophils; moreover we discovered a scavenger role for neutrophils in eliminating infected dead macrophages and non-immune cell types that failed to control Shigella infection. We observed that intracellular S. flexneri could escape to the cytosol, induce septin caging and be targeted to autophagy in vivo. Depletion of p62 (sequestosome 1 or SQSTM1), an adaptor protein critical for bacterial autophagy in vitro, significantly increased bacterial burden and host susceptibility to infection. These results show the zebrafish larva as a new model for the study of S. flexneri interaction with phagocytes, and the manipulation of autophagy for anti-bacterial therapy in vivo.},

Initiator proteins control the onset of DNA replication and direct the assembly of replisomal components through a series of precisely timed protein\textendash DNA and protein\textendash protein interactions. Recent structural studies of the bacterial protein DnaA have helped to clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying initiator function, and suggest that key structural features of cellular initiators are universally conserved. Moreover, it appears that bacteria use a diverse range of regulatory strategies dedicated to tightly controlling replication initiation; in many cases, these mechanisms are intricately connected to the activities of DnaA at the origin of replication. This Review presents an overview of both the mechanism and regulation of bacterial DNA replication initiation, with emphasis on the features that are similar in eukaryotic and archaeal systems.},

Listeriolysin O, a membrane-damaging cytotoxin accounts for intracellular multiplication through lysis of the membrane-bound phagocytic vacuole. This work demonstrates that once released within the cytosol, L. monocytogenes acquires the capacity to spread intracellularly and infect adjacent cells by interacting with host cell microfilaments. Such evidence was obtained by using drugs which disrupt the cell cytoskeleton. Nocodazole, which blocks polymerization of microtubules, did not affect intracellular spread, whereas cytochalasin D, which blocks polymerization of G-actin, inhibited the intracellular motility of the bacteria. By using fluorescence staining with 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-phallacidin (NBD-phallacidin), transmission electron microscopy, and immunogold labeling, direct evidence was obtained that intracellular bacteria were enveloped with a thick layer of F-actin. Within 2 h after entry, it was demonstrated by confocal microscopy that bacteria were following highly organized routes corresponding to stress fibers. Four hours after entry, some bacteria presented random movements which could be seen by the presence of a large trail of F-actin. Such movements also caused protrusions which deeply penetrated adjacent cells and resulted in the formation of vacuoles limited by a double membrane. After subsequent lysis of these membranes, bacteria released within the cytoplasm were able to multiply and invade new cells. In contrast, an hly::Tn1545 mutant of the wild-type microorganism demonstrated almost no intracellular spread. Only a few bacteria displaying delayed lysis of the phagocytic vacuole behaved like the wild-type strain. Hemolysin-mediated lysis of the phagocytic vacuole and subsequent interaction with host cell microfilaments may represent a major virulence factor allowing tissue colonization during listeriosis.},

In particular, they suffer consequences of Muller's ratchet, a mechanism that leads to extinction of small asexual populations due to fixation of slightly deleterious mutations combined with the random loss of the most-fit genotypes, which cannot be recreated without recombination. Mycoplasma-related endobacteria (MRE) are heritable symbionts of fungi from two ancient lineages, Glomeromycota (arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) and Mucoromycotina. Previous studies revealed that MRE maintain unusually diverse populations inside their hosts and may have been associated with fungi already in the early Paleozoic. Here we show that MRE are vulnerable to genomic degeneration and propose that they defy Muller's ratchet thanks to retention of recombination and genome plasticity. We suggest that other endobacteria may be capable of raising similar defenses against Muller's ratchet.},

While the cytotrophoblasts are highly invasive and proliferative with relatively less capacity to synthesize pregnancy related proteins, the multinucleated syncytiotrophoblasts are non-proliferative and non-invasive. However, syncytiotrophoblasts are the site of synthesis of a variety of protein, peptide and steroid hormones as well as several growth factors. Both the freshly isolated cytotrophoblasts from human placenta as well as the BeWo cell, a choriocarcinoma cell line model which retain several characteristic of cytotrophoblasts has been employed by us to study regulation of differentiation. In the present study, we have employed the differential display RT-PCR analysis (DD-RT-PCR) to evaluate gene expression changes during Forskolin induced in vitro differentiation of BeWo cells. We have identified several genes which are differentially expressed during differentiation and the differential expression of 10 transcripts was confirmed by Northern blot analysis. Based on the identity of the transcripts an attempt has been made to relate the known function of the gene products, to changes observed during differentiation. Of the several transcripts, one of the transcripts, namely Secretory Leukocyte Protease Inhibitor (SLPI) which is known to have multiple functions was found to increase 15-fold in the syntiotrophoblast.},

  abstract = {Listeria monocytogenes is the causative agent of infections like sepsis and meningitis, especially in immunocompromised hosts. Human macrophages are able to phagocytose and digest L. monocytogenes but IL-4 prevents human macrophages from killing the bacteria, the mechanisms of which are unknown. In the present study, we examined various listeria species and strains including wild-type and deletion mutants in human macrophages pretreated with IL-4. To analyse the IL-4-mediated deactivation process, we combined quantitative infection assays with various morphologic methods. IL-4 facilitates survival and escape of the pathogenic L. monocytogenes wild-type strain 10403S from the macrophage phagosomes. In untreated macrophages, the isogenic listeriolysin deletion mutant strain DP-L2161 was killed and did not escape from the phagolysosomes. However, after macrophage deactivation with IL-4 DP-L2161 survived and escaped from the phagosomes. This was also the case, but to a lesser extent, even for the naturally avirulent L. innocua. As detected by confocal laser-scanning fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy, IL-4 permitted the escape of all listeria species tested, including DP-L2161 and L. innocua from the phagosomal compartment of the macrophages. We conclude that escape from the phagosome and survival of the listeria species tested in IL-4-deactivated human macrophages is independent of the virulence factor listeriolysin.},

Alignment of these sequences, in light of the structures of the clamp loader {$\dottedsquare\dottedsquare\dottedsquare\dottedsquare$} subunit of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III and the hexamerization component of N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein, provides structural and mechanistic insights into these proteins, collectively designated the AAA+ class. Whole-genome analysis indicates that this class is ancient and has undergone considerable functional divergence prior to the emergence of the major divisions of life. These proteins often perform chaperone-like functions that assist in the assembly, operation, or disassembly of protein complexes. The hexameric architecture often associated with this class can provide a hole through which DNA or RNA can be thread; this may be important for assembly or remodeling of DNA\textendash protein complexes.},

A total of 528 fecal, 516 feed, and 1,012 environmental soil and water samples were cultured for L. monocytogenes. While the overall prevalence of L. monocytogenes in cattle case farms (24.4\%) was similar to that in control farms (20.2\%), small-ruminant (goat and sheep) farms showed a significantly (P {$<$} 0.0001) higher prevalence in case farms (32.9\%) than in control farms (5.9\%). EcoRI ribotyping of clinical (n = 17) and farm (n = 414) isolates differentiated 51 ribotypes. L. monocytogenes ribotypes isolated from clinical cases and fecal samples were more frequent in environmental than in feed samples, indicating that infected animals may contribute to L. monocytogenes dispersal into the farm environment. Ribotype DUP-1038B was significantly (P {$<$} 0.05) associated with fecal samples compared with farm environment and animal feedstuff samples. Ribotype DUP-1045A was significantly (P {$<$} 0.05) associated with soil compared to feces and with control farms compared to case farms. Our data indicate that (i) the epidemiology and transmission of L. monocytogenes differ between small-ruminant and cattle farms; (ii) cattle contribute to amplification and dispersal of L. monocytogenes into the farm environment, (iii) the bovine farm ecosystem maintains a high prevalence of L. monocytogenes, including subtypes linked to human listeriosis cases and outbreaks, and (iv) L. monocytogenes subtypes may differ in their abilities to infect animals and to survive in farm environments.},

Reversion is aided by using a higher concentration of agar in plates, by decreasing the sucrose concentration, and by omitting the antibiotics and horse serum.

This FS fixation usually leaves frozen tissues in the organic solvent with fixatives maintained below the freezing point. Therefore, cell and tissue structures in vivo can be well preserved to show their natural images. In the quick-freezing of fresh resected tissues, it is another problem that only the organization of outer tissue layers is captured under well-freezing conditions. So, we can distinguish the deeper tissue parts which are poorly kept at a slow speed of freezing condition. Moreover, the water contents in cells and tissues at well-frozen sites are stored to be as tiny amorphous ice, which usually facilitates the penetration of antibodies or probes for immunostaining or labeling. The IVCT or cryobiopsy with FS fixation also keeps soluble proteins in living animal organs for immunostaining. As described above, FS fixation method can maximize benefits of cryotechniques, which can usually maintain all the material components in the amorphous ice. The FS solution is usually organic acetone solvent, which contains paraformaldehyde for light microscopy. For paraffin-embedded sections, they are routinely embedded in paraffin wax after washing the freeze-substituted samples in pure acetone and xylene. In addition, it is possible to prepare serial HE-stained sections for comparison with immunoperoxidase or immunofluorescence staining. For light microscopic immunohistochemistry, immunoreactivities are often increased by tiny ice crystal formation in organ tissues, because of better penetration of antibodies.},

  abstract = {Background The lesser grain borer Rhyzopertha dominica (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae) is a stored-product pest beetle. Early histological studies dating back to 1930s have reported that R. dominica and other bostrichid species possess a pair of oval symbiotic organs, called the bacteriomes, in which the cytoplasm is densely populated by pleomorphic symbiotic bacteria of peculiar rosette-like shape. However, the microbiological nature of the symbiont has remained elusive. Results Here we investigated the bacterial symbiont of R. dominica using modern molecular, histological, and microscopic techniques. Whole-mount fluorescence in situ hybridization specifically targeting symbiotic bacteria consistently detected paired bacteriomes, in which the cytoplasm was full of pleomorphic bacterial cells, in the abdomen of adults, pupae and larvae, confirming previous histological descriptions. Molecular phylogenetic analysis identified the symbiont as a member of the Bacteroidetes, in which the symbiont constituted a distinct bacterial lineage allied to a variety of insect-associated endosymbiont clades, including Uzinura of diaspidid scales, Walczuchella of giant scales, Brownia of root mealybugs, Sulcia of diverse hemipterans, and Blattabacterium of roaches. The symbiont gene exhibited markedly AT-biased nucleotide composition and significantly accelerated molecular evolution, suggesting degenerative evolution of the symbiont genome. The symbiotic bacteria were detected in oocytes and embryos, confirming continuous host\textendash symbiont association and vertical symbiont transmission in the host life cycle. Conclusions We demonstrate that the symbiont of R. dominica constitutes a novel bacterial lineage in the Bacteroidetes. We propose that reductive evolution of the symbiont genome may be relevant to the amorphous morphology of the bacterial cells via disruption of genes involved in cell wall synthesis and cell division. Genomic and functional aspects of the host-symbiont relationship deserve future studies.},

  abstract = {Flagellar structures contribute to the virulence of multiple gastrointestinal pathogens either as the effectors of motility, as adhesins, or as a secretion apparatus for virulence factors. Listeria monocytogenes is a food-borne, gram-positive pathogen that uses flagella to increase the efficiency of epithelial cell invasion (A. Bigot, H. Pagniez, E. Botton, C. Frehel, I. Dubail, C. Jacquet, A. Charbit, and C. Raynaud, Infect. Immun. 73:5530-5539, 2005; L. Dons, E. Eriksson, Y. Jin, M. E. Rottenberg, K. Kristensson, C. N. Larsen, J. Bresciani, and J. E. Olsen, Infect. Immun. 72:3237-3244, 2004). In this study, we aimed to elucidate the mechanism by which flagella contribute to L. monocytogenes invasion. To examine the role of flagella as adhesins, invasion and adhesion assays were performed with flagellated motile and nonmotile bacteria and nonflagellated bacteria. We observed that flagellated but nonmotile bacteria do not adhere to or invade human epithelial cells more efficiently than nonflagellated bacteria. These results indicated that flagella do not function as adhesins to enhance the adhesion of L. monocytogenes to targeted host cells. Instead, it appears that motility is important for tissue culture invasion. Furthermore, we tested whether motility contributes to early colonization of the gastrointestinal tract using a competitive index assay in which mice were infected orally with motile and nonmotile bacteria in a 1:1 ratio. Differential bacterial counts demonstrated that motile bacteria outcompete nonmotile bacteria in the colonization of the intestines at early time points postinfection. This difference is also reflected in invasion of the liver 12 h later, suggesting that flagellum-mediated motility enhances L. monocytogenes infectivity soon after bacterial ingestion in vivo.},

Their presence has been known about for over a century, but a definite link to clinical disease outcomes has not been demonstrated. A number of case reports and laboratory studies suggest some disease associations, however. Considerable controversy surrounds the true relevance of CWDB to disease; there is a widespread belief that they may represent a response by the walled organism to adverse extracellular conditions like antibiotic pressure. This review looks at studies published between 1934 and 2003, which were identified by Dialog DataStar using the key words 'cell wall deficient bacteria and clinical significance and infections' and by further scanning the reference list at the end of the papers retrieved. We conclude that the evidence for the clinical significance of CWDB in disease is not compelling.},

  abstract = {Peptidoglycan is the predominant stress-bearing structure in the cell envelope of most bacteria, and also a potent stimulator of the eukaryotic immune system. Obligate intracellular bacteria replicate exclusively within the interior of living cells, an osmotically protected niche. Under these conditions peptidoglycan is not necessarily needed to maintain the integrity of the bacterial cell. Moreover, the presence of peptidoglycan puts bacteria at risk of detection and destruction by host peptidoglycan recognition factors and downstream effectors. This has resulted in a selective pressure and opportunity to reduce the levels of peptidoglycan. In this review we have analysed the occurrence of genes involved in peptidoglycan metabolism across the major obligate intracellular bacterial species. From this comparative analysis, we have identified a group of predicted ``peptidoglycan-intermediate'' organisms that includes the Chlamydiae, Orientia tsutsugamushi, Wolbachia and Anaplasma marginale. This grouping is likely to reflect biological differences in their infection cycle compared with peptidoglycan-negative obligate intracellular bacteria such as Ehrlichia and Anaplasma phagocytophilum, as well as obligate intracellular bacteria with classical peptidoglycan such as Coxiella, Buchnera and members of the Rickettsia genus. The signature gene set of the peptidoglycan-intermediate group reveals insights into minimal enzymatic requirements for building a peptidoglycan-like sacculus and/or division septum.

This technique does not, however, provide dynamic information on the intracellular behavior of the targeted molecules. The aim of this work was to investigate possibilities of labeled DNA probes for RNA detection in cells that are maintained alive. Such techniques will provide useful tools for studying dynamic cellular processes such as RNA distribution and transport from transcription sites to translation sites by means of fluorescence microscopy. First a reversible, nonperturbing cell permeabilization procedure was developed using streptolysin O. This procedure was used to introduce oligodeoxynucleotides and fluorochrome-labeled DNA probes specific for 28S ribosomal RNA (2.1 kb) into living cells, which were then analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. The results showed that: (i) no increased cell death or growth perturbation was observed after permeabilization, (ii) introduction of a 28S RNA-specific probe (plasmid and oligonucleotides) into living cells led to bright nucleoli and a low cytoplasmic signal, and (iii) negative control probes did not lead to any fluorescent staining. These results indicate that specific hybridization of labeled nucleic acid probes takes place while cells are maintained under normal physiological conditions.},

However, serotype 4b strains cause the majority of human listeriosis outbreaks. Our investigation of L. monocytogenes biofilms used a simulated food-processing system that consisted of repeated cycles of growth, sanitation treatment, and starvation to determine the competitive fitness of strains of serotypes 1/2a and 4b in pure and mixed-culture biofilms. Selective enumeration of strains of a certain serotype in mixed-culture biofilms on stainless steel coupons was accomplished by using serotype-specific quantitative PCR and propidium monoazide treatment to prevent amplification of extracellular DNA or DNA from dead cells. The results showed that the serotype 1/2a strains tested were generally more efficient at forming biofilms and predominated in the mixed-culture biofilms. The growth and survival of strains of one serotype were not inhibited by strains of the other serotype in mixed-culture biofilms. However, we found that a cocktail of serotype 4b strains survived and grew significantly better in mixed-culture biofilms containing a specific strain of serotype 1/2a (strain SK1387), with final cell densities averaging 0.5 log10 CFU/cm2 higher than without the serotype 1/2a strain. The methodology used in this study contributed to our understanding of how environmental stresses and microbial competition influence the survival and growth of L. monocytogenes in pure and mixed-culture biofilms.},

Levofloxacin is incorporated to inhibit the growth of microorganisms other than L. monocytogenes, especially Bacillus cereus, shown to possess PI-PLC and PC-PLC activities. L. monocyogenes produced white colonies with a halo on LL medium, whereas Listeria innocua appeared as white colonies without a halo.

  abstract = {Antibiotic resistance is now recognized as a major, global threat to human health and the need for the development of novel antibacterial therapies has become urgent. Lytic bacteriophages (phages) targeting individual bacterial pathogens have therapeutic potential as an alternative or adjunct to antibiotic use. Bacteriophage therapy has been used for decades, but clinical trials in this field are rare, leaving many questions unanswered as to its effectiveness for many infectious diseases. As a consequence bacteriophage therapy is not used or accepted in most parts of the world. The increasing need for new antimicrobial therapies is driving the development of bacteriophage therapies for a number of diseases but these require the successful completion of large-scale clinical trials in accordance with US FDA or European EMA guidelines. Bacteriophages are considered as biological agents by regulatory authorities and they are managed by biological medicinal products guidelines for European trials and guidelines of the division of vaccines and related product applications in the USA. Bacteriophage therapy is typically an `active' treatment requiring multiplication in the bacterial host and therefore the factors that govern its success are different from those of conventional antibiotics. From the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic points of view, time of treatment, dosage depending on the site of infection and the composition of the bacteriophage formulation (single vs multiple strains) need careful consideration when designing clinical trials. Scientific evidence regarding inflammatory effects, potential for gene transfer and phage resistance, need to be evaluated through such trials. However purity, stability and sterility of preparations for human use can be addressed through Good Manufacturing Practises to reduce many potential safety concerns. In this review we discuss the potential for the development of bacteriophage therapy in the context of critical aspects of modern, regulated clinical trials.},

  abstract = {Background: When interpreting sequencing data from multiple spatial or longitudinal biopsies, detecting sample mix-ups is essential, yet more difficult than in studies of germline variation. In most genomic studies of tumors, genetic variation is detected through pairwise comparisons of the tumor and a matched normal tissue from the sample donor. In many cases, only somatic variants are reported, which hinders the use of existing tools that detect sample swaps solely based on genotypes of inherited variants. To address this problem, we have developed Somalier, a tool that operates directly on alignments and does not require jointly called germline variants. Instead, Somalier extracts a small sketch of informative genetic variation for each sample. Sketches from hundreds of germline or somatic samples can then be compared in under a second, making Somalier a useful tool for measuring relatedness in large cohorts. Somalier produces both text output and an interactive visual report that facilitates the detection and correction of sample swaps using multiple relatedness metrics. Results: We introduce the tool and demonstrate its utility on a cohort of five glioma samples each with a normal, tumor, and cell-free DNA sample. Applying Somalier to high-coverage sequence data from the 1000 Genomes Project also identifies several related samples. We also demonstrate that it can distinguish pairs of whole-genome and RNA-seq samples from the same individuals in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. Conclusions: Somalier is a tool that can rapidly evaluate relatedness from sequencing data. It can be applied to diverse sequencing data types and genome builds and is available under an MIT license at github.com/brentp/ somalier.},

Many flagella were seen in cells grown at 20\textdegree C, whereas at 37\textdegree C very few were expressed. Flagella sheared from the cell surface were partially purified by differential centrifugation. Using SDS-PAGE and Western blotting two distinct protein bands were seen in this preparation, both with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 29 kDa. Further purification of these proteins was achieved by gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography. Whole organisms grown at 20\textdegree C and 37\textdegree C were examined in Western blots using an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody, and a monoclonal antibody, both directed against 29 kDa putative flagellin. Bacteria grown at 20\textdegree C expressed abundant flagellin, whereas only trace amounts could be detected in organisms grown at 37\textdegree C. It is concluded that organisms grown at 20\textdegree C both produce and assemble flagellin at the cell surface, and that flagellin production is a less marked feature of organisms grown at 37\textdegree C.},

  abstract = {A mechanistic understanding of the determination and maintenance of the simplest bacterial cell shape, a sphere, remains elusive compared with that of more complex shapes. Cocci seem to lack a dedicated elongation machinery, and a spherical shape has been considered an evolutionary dead-end morphology, as a transition from a spherical to a rod-like shape has never been observed in bacteria. Here we show that a Staphylococcus aureus mutant (M5) expressing the ftsZG193D allele exhibits elongated cells. Molecular dynamics simulations and in vitro studies indicate that FtsZG193D filaments are more twisted and shorter than wild-type filaments. In vivo, M5 cell wall deposition is initiated asymmetrically, only on one side of the cell, and progresses into a helical pattern rather than into a constricting ring as in wild-type cells. This helical pattern of wall insertion leads to elongation, as in rod-shaped cells. Thus, structural flexibility of FtsZ filaments can result in an FtsZ-dependent mechanism for generating elongated cells from cocci. IMPORTANCE The mechanisms by which bacteria generate and maintain even the simplest cell shape remain an elusive but fundamental question in microbiology. In the absence of examples of coccus-to-rod transitions, the spherical shape has been suggested to be an evolutionary dead end in morphogenesis. We describe the first observation of the generation of elongated cells from truly spherical cocci, occurring in a Staphylococcus aureus mutant containing a single point mutation in its genome, in the gene encoding the bacterial tubulin homologue FtsZ. We demonstrate that FtsZ-dependent cell elongation is possible, even in the absence of dedicated elongation machinery.},

Because of their sophisticated characteristics and versatile applicability, aptamers are thought to become universal molecular probes in biotechnological and therapeutic applications. However, the variety of possible interactions with a putative target molecule is limited by the chemical repertoire of the natural nucleobases. Consequently, many desired targets are not addressable by aptamers. This obstacle is overcome by broadening the chemical diversity of aptamers, mainly achieved by nucleobase-modifications and the introduction of novel bases or base pairs. We discuss these achievements and the characteristics of the respective modified aptamers, reflected by SOMAmers (slow off-rate modified aptamers), clickmers, and aptamers bearing an expanded genetic alphabet.},

L. monocytogenes virulence factors include two surface invasins, InlA and InlB, known to promote bacterial uptake by host cells, and the secreted pore-forming toxin listeriolysin O (LLO), which disrupts the phagosome to allow bacterial proliferation in the cytosol. In addition, plasma membrane perforation by LLO was shown to facilitate L. monocytogenes internalization into epithelial cells. In this work, we tested the host cell range and importance of LLO-mediated L. monocytogenes internalization relative to the canonical invasins, InlA and InlB. We measured the efficiencies of L. monocytogenes association with and internalization into several human cell types (hepatocytes, cytotrophoblasts, and endothelial cells) using wild type bacteria and isogenic single, double and triple deletion mutants for the genes encoding InlA, InlB and LLO. No role for InlB was detected in any tested cells unless InlB expression level was substantially enhanced, which was achieved by introducing a mutation (prfA*) in the gene encoding the transcription factor PrfA. On the contrary, InlA and LLO were the most critical invasion factors, although they act in a different manner and in a cell-type-dependent fashion. As expected, InlA facilitates both bacterial attachment and internalization in cells that express its receptor, E-cadherin. LLO promotes L. monocytogenes internalization into hepatocytes, but not into cytotrophoblasts and endothelial cells. Finally, LLO and InlA cooperate to increase the efficiency of host cell invasion by L. monocytogenes.},

Forty-five distinctive allele profiles (electrophoretic types, ETs) were distinguished, among which mean genetic diversity per locus (H) was 0.424. Cluster analysis of a matrix of genetic distances between paired ETs revealed two primary phylogenetic divisions of the species separated at a distance of 0.54. ETs in division I were presented by strains of serotypes 4b, 1/2b, and 4a, whereas strains of ETs in division II were of serotypes 1/2a and 1/2c. Human and animal isolates did not represent distinctive subsets of ETs. The occurrence of linkage disequilibrium between enzyme loci and the widespread distribution of certain ETs indicate that the genetic structure ofL. monocytogenes is clonal. One clone, marked by ET 1, caused major epidemics of human disease in western Switzerland in the period 1983-1987 and in Los Angeles County, California, in 1985, both of which were attributed to contamination of soft cheese. ET 1 is closely related to the clone (ET 7) that caused two large outbreaks of listeriosis in Massachusetts in 1979 and 1983.},

To get an insight into all the cellular components necessary for uptake and early intracellular life, we undertook a global proteomic characterization of the early listerial phagosome in the human epithelial cell line LoVo. First, we proceeded to an immunocytochemical characterization of intracellular marker recruitment to phagosomes containing latex beads coated with InlA or InlB. E-cadherin and c-Met were, as expected, rapidly recruited to the phagosomal formation site. Phagosomes subsequently acquired the early endosomal antigen 1 (EEA1) and the lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1), while presenting a more delayed enrichment of the lysosomal hydrolase cathepsin D. Early phagosomes devoid of lysosomal, endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi enzymatic activities could then be isolated by subcellular fractionation of LoVo cells. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DPAGE) revealed differences between the protein profiles of InlA- or InlB-phagosomes and those of early/late endosomes or lysosomes of naive LoVo cells. One major protein specifically recruited on the InlB-phagosomes was identified by mass spectrometry as MSF, a previously reported member of the septin family of GTPases. MSF forms filaments that co-localize with the actin cytoskeleton in resting cells and it is recruited to the entry site of InlB-coated beads. These results suggest that MSF is a putative effector of the InlB-mediated internalization of L. monocytogenes into host cells.},

  abstract = {Upon entry into the host cell cytosol, the facultative intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes coordinates the expression of numerous essential virulence factors by allosteric binding of glutathione (GSH) to the Crp-Fnr family transcriptional regulator PrfA. Here, we report that robust virulence gene expression can be recapitulated by growing bacteria in a synthetic medium containing GSH or other chemical reducing agents. Bacteria grown under these conditions were 45-fold more virulent in an acute murine infection model and conferred greater immunity to a subsequent lethal challenge than bacteria grown in conventional media. During cultivation in vitro, PrfA activation was completely dependent on the intracellular levels of GSH, as a glutathione synthase mutant ({$\Delta$}gshF) was activated by exogenous GSH but not reducing agents. PrfA activation was repressed in a synthetic medium supplemented with oligopeptides, but the repression was relieved by stimulation of the stringent response. These data suggest that cytosolic L. monocytogenes interprets a combination of metabolic and redox cues as a signal to initiate robust virulence gene expression in vivo. IMPORTANCE Intracellular pathogens are responsible for much of the worldwide morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases. These pathogens have evolved various strategies to proliferate within individual cells of the host and avoid the host immune response. Through cellular invasion or the use of specialized secretion machinery, all intracellular pathogens must access the host cell cytosol to establish their replicative niches. Determining how these pathogens sense and respond to the intracellular compartment to establish a successful infection is critical to our basic understanding of the pathogenesis of each organism and for the rational design of therapeutic interventions. Listeria monocytogenes is a model intracellular pathogen with robust in vitro and in vivo infection models. Studies of the host-sensing and downstream signaling mechanisms evolved by L. monocytogenes often describe themes of pathogenesis that are broadly applicable to less tractable pathogens. Here, we describe how bacteria use external redox states as a cue to activate virulence.},

  abstract = {Back to TopAbstract Listeria monocytogenes has emerged as a remarkably tractable pathogen to dissect basic aspects of cell biology, intracellular pathogenesis, and innate and acquired immunity. In order to maintain its intracellular lifestyle, L. monocytogenes has evolved a number of mechanisms to exploit host processes to grow and spread cell to cell without damaging the host cell. The pore-forming protein listeriolysin O mediates escape from host vacuoles and utilizes multiple fail-safe mechanisms to avoid causing toxicity to infected cells. Once in the cytosol, the L. monocytogenes ActA protein recruits host cell Arp2/3 complexes and enabled/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein family members to mediate efficient actin-based motility, thereby propelling the bacteria into neighboring cells. Alteration in any of these processes dramatically reduces the ability of the bacteria to establish a productive infection in vivo.},

  abstract = {Symbiogenic evolution, which involves transformations of bacteria into the cellular organelles, is represented as a model for reconstructing the early stages of genome evolution, including the origin of DNA genomes from RNA genomes and the emergence of template processes on the basis of self replicating molec ular complexes in the ancestral metabolic systems. The antiquity of RNA genomes is supported by an increased evolutionary stability of ribosomal protein synthesis (translation) with respect to the DNA depen dent template processes (replication, transcription, recombination, and reparation). This stability is demon strated by analysis of the deeply reduced genomes of symbiotic bacteria and cellular organelles as well as the ``minimal'' genomes which are common to phylogenetically diverse organisms. Higher evolutionary conser vation of template biosynthetic processes with respect to step processes determining the metabolism and development in cells does not support the hypothesis about emergence of genomes within the ancestral cel lular metabolic systems which are thought to be of abiogenic origin, instead suggesting dualistic origin of life on Earth. We suppose that the genome free organelles of some eukaryotes (mitosomes, many hydrogenos omes, and some plastids) represent the products of reversion of symbiotic bacteria into ancestral forms which implemented their basic cellular functions using the informational macromolecules of exogenic origin. In the framework of this hypothesis the eukaryotic cells functioning based on the massive transfer of gene products (RNAs, proteins) from cytosol to organelles may represent the analogs of ancestral biocenoses that possessed integral hereditary systems (metagenomes).},

EGFR receptor tyrosine kinases are currently being targeted in a number of malignancies. METHODS: Apoptosis was studied by FACS analysis using propidium iodide. EGF and HGF signaling intermediates were studied by western blotting. Cell proliferation was determined by MTT assays. Cell motility was done by time lapse confocal microscopy. RESULTS: c-Met and EGFR were both expressed in A549, H1838, H2170, SW900, SW1573, H358, SKLU-1, and H1993 non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. Both EGF and HGF at 100 ng/ml in medium showed a synergistic effect on cell proliferation at 48-72 h as seen by a proliferation assay in A549, H1838, and SKMES cells. In A549 and H1838 cell lines, HGF (40 ng/ml) and EGF (5 ng/ml) induced synergistic phosphorylation on c-Met (Tyr 1003/1230/1234/1235). Additionally, synergistic phosphorylation of Akt (Ser-473) and phospho-ERK1+ERK2 (Thr202/Tyr204) was also seen indicating that EGF and HGF could induce synergistic phosphorylation of important signaling intermediates. Treatment with EGF and HGF at 100 ng/ml for 2 h also leads to an additive effect in inducing cell motility (especially membrane ruffling) in H1993 cells. A novel c-Met small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor SU11274 and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors Tyrphostin AG1478 and gefitinib (Iressa) were tested to study their effect in combination on proliferation and apoptosis in lung cancer cells. Interestingly, a synergistic effect on inhibition of cell proliferation was seen in the presence of SU11274 and Tyrphostin AG1478. 0.5 microM Tyrphostin AG1478 and 2 microM SU11274 inhibited growth by 21\% and 25\%, respectively; a combination of both tyrosine kinase inhibitors inhibited growth by 65\%. Interestingly, EGFR inhibitor (gefitinib, Iressa) and c-Met inhibitor (SU11274) also had a synergistic effect on apoptosis in H358 cells. CONCLUSION: There was a synergistic effect of EGF and HGF on proliferation, downstream activation of signal transduction and an additive effect seen on motility. These studies show that a combination of HGF and EGF tyrosine kinase inhibitors on NSCLC, could potentially be targeted in a synergistic fashion.},

EGF and HGF signaling intermediates were studied by western blotting. Cell proliferation was determined by MTT assays. Cell motility was done by time lapse confocal microscopy. Results: c-Met and EGFR were both expressed in A549, H1838, H2170, SW900, SW1573, H358, SKLU-1, and H1993 non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. Both EGF and HGF at 100 ng/ml in medium showed a synergistic effect on cell proliferation at 48\textendash 72 h as seen by a proliferation assay in A549, H1838, and SKMES cells. In A549 and H1838 cell lines, HGF (40 ng/ml) and EGF (5 ng/ml) induced synergistic phosphorylation on c-Met (Tyr 1003/1230/1234/1235). Additionally, synergistic phosphorylation of Akt (Ser-473) and phospho-ERK1+ERK2 (Thr202/Tyr204) was also seen indicating that EGF and HGF could induce synergistic phosphorylation of important signaling intermediates. Treatment with EGF and HGF at 100 ng/ml for 2 h also leads to an additive effect in inducing cell motility (especially membrane ruffling) in H1993 cells. A novel c-Met small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor SU11274 and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors Tyrphostin AG1478 and gefitinib (Iressa) were tested to study their effect in combination on proliferation and apoptosis in lung cancer cells. Interestingly, a synergistic effect on inhibition of cell proliferation was seen in the presence of SU11274 and Tyrphostin AG1478. 0.5 \textmu M Tyrphostin AG1478 and 2 \textmu M SU11274 inhibited growth by 21\% and 25\%, respectively; a combination of both tyrosine kinase inhibitors inhibited growth by 65\%. Interestingly, EGFR inhibitor (gefitinib, Iressa) and c-Met inhibitor (SU11274) also had a synergistic effect on apoptosis in H358 cells. Conclusion: There was a synergistic effect of EGF and HGF on proliferation, downstream activation of signal transduction and an additive effect seen on motility. These studies show that a combination of HGF and EGF tyrosine kinase inhibitors on NSCLC, could potentially be targeted in a synergistic fashion.},

It cleaves the {$\beta$}-1,4 glycosidic bonds between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine of bacterial peptidoglycan and induce bacterial lysis. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), an opportunistic commensal pathogen, is highly resistant to lysozyme, because of the O-acetylation of peptidoglycan by O-acetyl transferase (oatA). To understand the structure\textendash function relationship of lysozyme resistance in S. aureus by peptidoglycan O-acetylation, we adapted an integrated approach to (i) understand the effect of lysozyme on the growth of S. aureus parental and the oatA mutant strain, (ii) study the lysozyme induced lysis of exponentially grown and stationary phase of both the S. aureus parental and oatA mutant strain, (iii) investigate the dynamic interaction mechanism between normal (de-O-acetylated) and O-acetylated peptidoglycan substrate in complex with lysozyme using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations, and (iv) quantify lysozyme resistance of S. aureus parental and the oatA mutant in different human biological fluids. The results indicated for the first time that the active site cleft of lysozyme binding with O-acetylated peptidoglycan in S. aureus was sterically hindered and the structural stability was higher for the lysozyme in complex with normal peptidoglycan. This could have conferred reduced survival of the S. aureus oatA mutant in different human biological fluids. Consistent with this computational analysis, the experimental data confirmed decrease in the growth, lysozyme induced lysis, and lysozyme resistance, due to peptidoglycan O-acetylation in S. aureus.},

Here, we describe a novel image-based microscopy assay that allows discrimination between cellular entry and vacuolar escape, enabling high-content screening to identify factors specifically involved in these two steps. We first generated L. monocytogenes and Listeria innocua strains expressing a {$\beta$}-lactamase covalently attached to the bacterial cell wall. These strains were then incubated with HeLa cells containing the F\"orster resonance energy transfer (FRET) probe CCF4 in their cytoplasm. The CCF4 probe was cleaved by the bacterial surface {$\beta$}-lactamase only in cells inoculated with L. monocytogenes but not those inoculated with L. innocua, thereby demonstrating bacterial access to the host cytoplasm. Subsequently, we performed differential immunofluorescence staining to distinguish extracellular versus total bacterial populations in samples that were also analyzed by the FRET-based assay. With this two-step analysis, bacterial entry can be distinguished from vacuolar rupture in a single experiment. Our novel approach represents a powerful tool for identifying factors that determine the intracellular niche of L. monocytogenes.},

Most PCR data analysis procedures assume that the PCR efficiency for the amplicon of interest is constant or even, in the case of the comparative Ct method, equal to 2. The latter method already leads to a 4-fold error when the PCR efficiencies vary over just a 0.04 range. PCR efficiencies of amplicons are usually calculated from standard curves based on either known RNA inputs or on dilution series of a reference cDNA sample. In this paper we show that the first approach can lead to PCR efficiencies that vary over a 0.2 range, whereas the second approach may be off by 0.26. Therefore, we propose linear regression on the Log(fluorescence) per cycle number data as an assumption-free method to calculate starting concentrations of mRNAs and PCR efficiencies for each sample. A computer program to perform this calculation is available on request (e-mail: bioinfo@amc.uva.nl; subject: LinRegPCR).},

  abstract = {Vascular endothelial cells act as gatekeepers that protect underlying tissue from blood-borne toxins and pathogens. Nevertheless, endothelial cells are able to internalize large fibrin clots and apoptotic debris from the bloodstream, although the precise mechanism of such phagocytosis-like uptake is unknown. We show that cultured primary human endothelial cells (HUVEC) internalize both pathogenic and non-pathogenic Listeria bacteria comparably, in a phagocytosis-like process. In contrast with previously studied host cell types, including intestinal epithelial cells and hepatocytes, we find that endothelial internalization of Listeria is independent of all known pathogenic bacterial surface proteins. Consequently, we exploited the internalization and intracellular replication of L. monocytogenes to identify distinct host cell factors that regulate phagocytosis-like uptake in HUVEC. Using siRNA screening and subsequent genetic and pharmacologic perturbations, we determined that endothelial infectivity was modulated by cytoskeletal proteins that normally modulate global architectural changes, including phosphoinositide-3-kinase, focal adhesions, and the small GTPase Rho. We found that Rho kinase (ROCK) is acutely necessary for adhesion of Listeria to endothelial cells, whereas the actin-nucleating formins FHOD1 and FMNL3 specifically regulate internalization of bacteria as well as inert beads, demonstrating that formins regulate endothelial phagocytosis-like uptake independent of the specific cargo. Finally, we found that neither ROCK nor formins were required for macrophage phagocytosis of L. monocytogenes, suggesting that endothelial cells have distinct requirements for bacterial internalization from those of classical professional phagocytes. Our results identify a novel pathway for L. monocytogenes uptake by human host cells, indicating that this wily pathogen can invade a variety of tissues by using a surprisingly diverse suite of distinct uptake mechanisms that operate differentially in different host cell types., Vascular endothelial cells, which line the lumen of blood vessels, are conventionally viewed as a restrictive barrier that protects underlying tissue from blood-borne toxins and pathogens. Nonetheless, even highly restrictive endothelial cells can internalize micron-sized objects, such as blood clots, raising the question of how such phagocytosis-like uptake occurs, and whether it is mechanistically distinct from classical phagocytic pathways. We found that the pathogenic bacterium Listeria monocytogenes, which must overcome the endothelial barrier to access underlying tissue, can be taken up by primary endothelial cells (HUVEC) in culture. We exploited this ability to identify molecular regulators of such phagocytosis-like uptake. We found that the formin family of actin nucleators drives such uptake, whereas these proteins did not have a significant role in phagocytosis of L. monocytogenes by macrophages. Thus, our data suggest that endothelial cells and macrophages use distinct phagocytosis-like pathways to internalize L. monocytogenes. Perturbations of the regulatory proteins that we have identified here should allow for dissection of the normal physiological functions of endothelial phagocytosis-like uptake, as well as its therapeutic potential in diverse roles such as clot resolution and drug delivery.},

  abstract = {Bacteriophage endolysins (lysins) bind to a cell wall substrate and cleave peptidoglycan, resulting in hypotonic lysis of the phage-infected bacteria. When purified lysins are added externally to Gram-positive bacteria they mediate rapid death by the same mechanism. For this reason, novel therapeutic strategies have been developed using such enzybiotics. However, like other proteins introduced into mammalian organisms, they are quickly cleared from systemic circulation. PEGylation has been used successfully to increase the in vivo half-life of many biological molecules and was therefore applied to Cpl-1, a lysin specific for S. pneumoniae. Cysteine-specific PEGylation with either PEG 10K or 40K was achieved on Cpl-1 mutants, each containing an additional cysteine residue at different locations To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the PEGylation of bacteriophage lysin. Compared to the native enzyme, none of the PEGylated conjugates retained significant in vitro anti-pneumococcal lytic activity that would have justified further in vivo studies. Since the anti-microbial activity of the mutant enzymes used in this study was not affected by the introduction of the cysteine residue, our results implied that the presence of the PEG molecule was responsible for the inhibition. As most endolysins exhibit a similar modular structure, we believe that our work emphasizes the inability to improve the in vivo half-life of this class of enzybiotics using a cysteine-specific PEGylation strategy.

  abstract = {The cell division protein GpsB is a regulator of the penicillin binding protein A1 (PBP A1) in the Gram-positive human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. Penicillin binding proteins mediate the last two steps of peptidoglycan biosynthesis as they polymerize and cross-link peptidoglycan strands, the main components of the bacterial cell wall. It is not known what other processes are controlled by GpsB. L. monocytogenes gpsB mutants are unable to grow at 42\textdegree C, but we observed that spontaneous suppressors correcting this defect arise on agar plates with high frequency. We here describe a first set of gpsB suppressors that mapped to the clpC and murZ genes. While ClpC is the ATPase component of the Clp protease, MurZ is a paralogue of the listerial UDP\textendash N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) 1-carboxyvinyltransferase MurA. Both enzymes catalyze the enolpyruvyl transfer from phosphoenolpyruvate to UDP-GlcNAc, representing the first committed step of peptidoglycan biosynthesis. We confirmed that clean deletion of the clpC or murZ gene suppressed the {$\Delta$}gpsB phenotype. It turned out that the absence of either gene leads to accumulation of MurA, and we show that artificial overexpression of MurA alone was sufficient for suppression. Inactivation of other UDP-GlcNAc-consuming pathways also suppressed the heat-sensitive growth of the {$\Delta$}gpsB mutant, suggesting that an increased influx of precursor molecules into peptidoglycan biosynthesis can compensate for the lack of GpsB. Our results support a model according to which PBP A1 becomes misregulated and thus toxic in the absence of GpsB due to unproductive consumption of cell wall precursor molecules. IMPORTANCE The late cell division protein GpsB is important for cell wall biosynthesis in Gram-positive bacteria. GpsB of the human pathogen L. monocytogenes interacts with one of the key enzymes of this pathway, penicillin binding protein A1 (PBP A1), and influences its activity. PBP A1 catalyzes the last two steps of cell wall biosynthesis, but it is unknown how GpsB controls PBP A1. We observed that a L. monocytogenes gpsB mutant forms spontaneous suppressors and have mapped their mutations to genes mediating and influencing the first step of cell wall biosynthesis, likely stimulating the influx of metabolites into this pathway. We assume that GpsB is important to ensure productive incorporation of cell wall precursors into the peptidoglycan sacculus by PBP A1.},

While recent studies indicate a crucial role of HGF in brain angiogenesis, the signaling pathways that regulate brain endothelial cell migration by HGF remain uncharacterized. Herein, we report that HGF stimulated human brain microvascular endothelial cell (HBMEC) migration in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Challenge of HBMECs with HGF activated the c-jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK), increased phosphorylation of the proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk-2) at Tyr402 and activated c-Src. Inhibition of JNK by SP600125 or expression of a dominant negative JNK1 construct abrogated the migratory response of HBMECs to HGF. Treatment of HBMECs with the Src inhibitor PP2 markedly decreased HGF-stimulated JNK activation and migration to HGF. Moreover, expression of a mutant Pyk-2 construct prevented HGF-induced Pyk-2 phosphorylation at Tyr402 and stimulation of HBMEC migration. Next, we examined activation of the extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. Stimulation of HBMECs by HGF led to rapid activation of ERK1/2, phosphorylation of Raf-1 at Ser338 and Tyr340/341 and MEK1/2 at Ser222. Moreover, inhibition of ERK activation by UO126 and PD98059 markedly decreased HGF-stimulated HBMEC migration. HGF also activated AKT, while inhibition of AKT by LY294002 induced a modest decrease of HGF-induced HBMEC migration. These results highlight a model whereby JNK and ERK play a critical role in regulation of brain endothelial cell migration by HGF.},

A single amino acid substitution at position 16 in mouse E-cadherin prevents this interaction. Synthetic polypeptides of 30 aa encompassing position 16 of human and mouse E-cadherin were tested for their ability to inhibit in vitro invasion of Caco-2, HepG2 and TIB73 cell lines by L. monocytogenes. Only the human-derived peptide was capable of inhibiting invasion in the human-origin Caco-2 and HepG2 cell lines. These findings demonstrate that small polypeptides can inhibit invasion of biologically relevant cell types by L. monocytogenes in vitro and may be potentially useful as therapeutic agents in vivo.},

  abstract = {Current models put forward that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is efficiently internalized via clathrin-coated pits only in response to ligand-induced activation of its intrinsic tyrosine kinase and is subsequently directed into a lysosomal-proteasomal degradation pathway by mechanisms that include receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and ubiquitylation. Herein, we report a novel mechanism of EGFR internalization that does not require ligand binding, receptor kinase activity, or ubiquitylation and does not direct the receptor into a degradative pathway. Inhibition of basal protein kinase A (PKA) activity by H89 and the cell-permeable substrate peptide Myr-PKI induced internalization of 40\textendash 60\% unoccupied, inactive EGFR, and its accumulation into early endosomes without affecting endocytosis of transferrin and {$\mu$}-opioid receptors. This effect was abrogated by interfering with clathrin function. Thus, the predominant distribution of inactive EGFR at the plasma membrane is not simply by default but involves a PKA-dependent restrictive condition resulting in receptor avoidance of endocytosis until it is stimulated by ligand. Furthermore, PKA inhibition may contribute to ligand-induced EGFR endocytosis because epidermal growth factor inhibited 26\% of PKA basal activity. On the other hand, H89 did not alter ligand-induced internalization of EGFR but doubled its half-time of down-regulation by retarding its segregation into degradative compartments, seemingly due to a delay in the receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and ubiquitylation. Our results reveal that PKA basal activity controls EGFR function at two levels: 1) residence time of inactive EGFR at the cell surface by a process of ``endocytic evasion,'' modulating the accessibility of receptors to stimuli; and 2) sorting events leading to the down-regulation pathway of ligand-activated EGFR, determining the length of its intracellular signaling. They add a new dimension to the fine-tuning of EGFR function in response to cellular demands and cross talk with other signaling receptors.},

  abstract = {Listeria monocytogenes is a food-borne bacterial pathogen and the causative agent of human and animal listeriosis. Among the three major genetic lineages of L. monocytogenes (i.e., LI, LII, and LIII), LI and LII are predominantly associated with food-borne listeriosis outbreaks, whereas LIII is rarely implicated in human infections. In a previous study, we identified a Crp/Fnr family transcription factor gene, lmo0753, that was highly specific to outbreak-associated LI and LII but absent from LIII. Lmo0753 shares two conserved functional domains, including a DNA binding domain, with the well-characterized master virulence regulator PrfA in L. monocytogenes. In this study, we constructed lmo0753 deletion and complementation mutants in two fully sequenced L. monocytogenes LII strains, 10403S and EGDe, and compared the flagellar motility, phospholipase C production, hemolysis, and intracellular growth of the mutants and their respective wild types. Our results suggested that lmo0753 plays a role in hemolytic activity in both EGDe and 10403S. More interestingly, we found that deletion of lmo0753 led to the loss of l-rhamnose utilization in EGDe, but not in 10403S. RNA-seq analysis of EGDe {$\Delta$}0753 incubated in phenol red medium containing l-rhamnose as the sole carbon source revealed that 126 (4.5\%) and 546 (19.5\%) out of 2,798 genes in the EGDe genome were up- and downregulated more than 2-fold, respectively, compared to the wild-type strain. Genes related to biotin biosynthesis, general stress response, and rhamnose metabolism were shown to be differentially regulated. Findings from this study collectively suggested varied functional roles of lmo0753 in different LII L. monocytogenes strain backgrounds associated with human listeriosis outbreaks.},

In this study, a simple, cheap, easy-to-assemble, and easy-to-use setup with a straightforward, accurate, and efficacious calibration method is introduced. The accuracy of this calibration method was tested by comparing with the results of calibration methods that are currently used in high-cost systems. Injection success with this low-cost system was verified based on the presence of injected dyes in zebrafish embryos, the absence of any significant morphological and behavioral differences between 3,4,-dichloroaniline-treated and untreated embryos, and larval viability.},

  abstract = {When deprived of FtsZ, Escherichia coli cells (VIP205) grown in liquid form long nonseptated filaments due to their inability to assemble an FtsZ ring and their failure to recruit subsequent divisome components. These filaments fail to produce colonies on solid medium, in which synthesis of FtsZ is induced, upon being diluted by a factor greater than 4. However, once the initial FtsZ levels are recovered in liquid culture, they resume division, and their plating efficiency returns to normal. The potential septation sites generated in the FtsZ-deprived filaments are not annihilated, and once sufficient FtsZ is accumulated, they all become active and divide to produce cells of normal length. FtsZ-deprived cells accumulate defects in their physiology, including an abnormally high number of unsegregated nucleoids that may result from the misplacement of FtsK. Their membrane integrity becomes compromised and the amount of membrane proteins, such as FtsK and ZipA, increases. FtsZ-deprived cells also show an altered expression pattern, namely, transcription of several genes responding to DNA damage increases, whereas transcription of some ribosomal or global transcriptional regulators decreases. We propose that the changes caused by the depletion of FtsZ, besides stopping division, weaken the cell, diminishing its resiliency to minor challenges, such as dilution stress. IMPORTANCE Our results suggest a role for FtsZ, in addition to its already known effect in the constriction of E. coli, in protecting the nondividing cells against minor stress. This protection can even be exerted when an inactive FtsZ is produced, but it is lost when the protein is altogether absent. These results have implications in fields like synthetic biology or antimicrobial discovery. The construction of synthetic divisomes in the test tube may need to preserve unsuspected roles, such as this newly found FtsZ property, to guarantee the stability of artificial containers. Whereas the effects on viability caused by inhibiting the activity of FtsZ may be partly overcome by filamentation, the absence of FtsZ is not tolerated by E. coli, an observation that may help in the design of effective antimicrobial compounds.},

  abstract = {The assembly of actin into a cleavage furrow is accompanied by disassembly of the interphase actin cytoskeleton. A variation of this actin filament disassembly/assembly cycle is seen during cell division in PtK2 cells infected with the intracellular pathogen, Listeria monocytogenes, where F-actin associates with the bacteria either as a halo surrounding nonmoving bacteria, or as an array of filaments that encases the sides of moving baceteria and extends behind them like a tail. The moving Listeria are found both in the cytoplasm and in the distal ends of undulating filopodia. When infected cells enter mitosis, the distribution of moving and stationary bacteria changes. In the transition from prophase to metaphase, there is a decrease in the number of bacteria with tails of actin in the cytoplasm. The nonmoving bacteria surrounded with F-actin are excluded from the mitotic spindle and moving bacteria are seldom seen in the cytoplasm during mitosis, although small thin filopodia cluster at the edges of the cells. After completion of cytokinesis, strong tail reformation first becomes obvious in the filopodia with Listeria moving back into the cytoplasm as the daughter cells spread. In summary, the disassembly and reassembly of actin tails extending from Listeria in dividing cells is a variation of the changes in actin organization produced by stress fiber and myofibril disassembly/assembly cycles during cell division. We suggest that the same unknown factors that regulate the disassembly/assembly of stress fibers and myofibrils during mitosis and post cytokinesis also affect the movement of Listeria inside mitotic cells. \textcopyright{} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {The genus Listeria comprises food-borne pathogens associated with severe infections and a high mortality rate. Endolysins from bacteriophages infecting Listeria are promising tools for both their detection and control. These proteins feature a modular organization, consisting of an N-terminal enzymatically active domain (EAD), which contributes lytic activity, and a C-terminal cell wall binding domain (CBD), which targets the lysin to its substrate. Sequence comparison among 12 different endolysins revealed high diversity among the enzyme's functional domains and allowed classification of their CBDs into two major groups and five subclasses. This diversity is reflected in various binding properties, as determined by cell wall binding assays using CBDs fused to fluorescent marker proteins. Although some proteins exhibited a broad binding range and recognize Listeria strains representing all serovars, others target specific serovars only. The CBDs also differed with respect to the number and distribution of ligands recognized on the cells, as well as their binding affinities. Surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed equilibrium affinities in the pico- to nanomolar ranges for all proteins except CBD006, which is due to an internal truncation. Rapid multiplexed detection and differentiation of Listeria strains in mixed bacterial cultures was possible by combining CBDs of different binding specificities with fluorescent markers of various colors. In addition, cells of different Listeria strains could be recovered from artificially contaminated milk or cheese by CBD-based magnetic separation by using broad-range CBDP40 and subsequently identified after incubation with two differently colored CBD fusion proteins of higher specificity.},

Conventional culture methods are hampered by lengthy enrichment and incubation steps. Bacteriophage-derived high-affinity binding molecules (cell wall-binding domains, CBDs) specific for Listeria cells have recently been introduced as tools for detection and differentiation of this pathogen in foods. When coupled with magnetic separation, these proteins offer advantages in sensitivity and speed compared to the standard diagnostic methods. Furthermore, fusion of CBDs to differently colored fluorescent reporter proteins enables differentiation of Listeria strains in mixed cultures. This chapter provides protocols for detection of Listeria in food by CBD-based magnetic separation and subsequent multiplexed identification of strains of different serotypes with reporter-CBD fusion proteins.},

  abstract = {Based on comparative analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences, two oligonucleotide probes for in situ detection of all members of the genus Listeria were designed. These probes allowed fast and reliable in situ detection of Listeria spp. even in complex samples like raw milk. Almost full-length iap (invasion-associated protein) gene sequences were determined for 69 Listeria monocytogenes strains of all 13 known serotypes. A comparison of these sequences revealed that the L. monocytogenes strains can be grouped into three distinct genotypes. These clusters correlate well with distinct serotypes. Thus, strains of serotypes b and d belong to genotype I, a and c to genotype II, and 4a and 4c, which are rarely isolated from humans, group together within genotype III. These results could be corroborated by further comparative sequence analysis of genes encoding two phospholipases \textendash plcA and plcB. Based on the iap gene sequences, a highly specific and reproducible competitive PCR detection method was developed. Primer pairs targeting genotype-specific regions of the iap gene were designed. The amplification of non-specific PCR products from DNA of non-target strains was prevented by adding competitive primers. By applying this method, the rapid and reliable distinction of the three L. monocytogenes genotypes was possible.},

  abstract = {Stable L-forms are cell wall-deficient bacteria which are able to multiply and propagate indefinitely, despite the absence of a rigid peptidoglycan cell wall. We investigated whether L-forms of the intracellular pathogen L. monocytogenes possibly retain pathogenicity, and if they could trigger an innate immune response. While phagocytosis of L. monocytogenes L-forms by non-activated macrophages sometimes resulted in an unexpected persistence of the bacteria in the phagocytes, they were effectively eliminated by IFN-{$\gamma$} preactivated or bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM). These findings were in line with the observed down-regulation of virulence factors in the cell-wall deficient L. monocytogenes. Absence of Interferon-{$\beta$} (IFN-{$\beta$}) triggering indicated inability of L-forms to escape from the phagosome into the cytosol. Moreover, abrogated cytokine response in MyD88-deficient dendritic cells (DC) challenged with L. monocytogenes L-forms suggested an exclusive TLR-dependent host response. Taken together, our data demonstrate a strong attenuation of Listeria monocytogenes L-form pathogenicity, due to diminished expression of virulence factors and innate immunity recognition, eventually resulting in elimination of L-form bacteria from phagocytes.},

  abstract = {Listeria monocytogenes is a facultative intracellular organism that is capable of replicating within macrophage and macrophage-like cells. The species secretes a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) encoded by the plcA gene. A plcA gene from L. monocytogenes was cloned downstream of a gram-positive promoter in the plasmid pWS2-2. To determine what effect plcA would have on intracellular survival when introduced into Listeria innocua, a species that does not growth intracellularly or contain plcA, transformation with the recombinant pWS2-2 plasmid was performed. Phospholipase C activity in Listeria innocua/pWS2-2 was confirmed on a brain heart infusion-phosphatidylinositol agar plate, whereas wild-type L. innocua did not produce PI-PLC activity. Intracellular growth of L. innocua/pWS2-2 was subsequently measured in the macrophage-like cell line J774 by Giemsa staining and viable count determinations at specific time points following infection. The J774 cells infected with wild-type L. innocua showed a falling viable count through 8 h postinfection. Although J774 cells infected with L. innocua/pWS2-2 also initially displayed reduced viable counts, the viable count rose after 6 h postinfection and increased further at 8 h postinfection before a subsequent decline again at 16 h postinfection. Giemsa staining revealed fewer than 6 bacteria in individual macrophage cells at 2 h postinfection, and yet approximately 15\% of the J774 cells had 6 to 12 bacteria localized to one area of the macrophage cell after 6 h; moreover, electron micrographs showed that the L. innocua/pWS2-2 cells were replicating inside the phagosome of the host cell. Furthermore, Thoria Sol labeling demonstrated that lysosomes had fused with these phagosomes, and acridine orange staining revealed that the compartments were acidified. These results demonstrate that L. innocua cells transformed with the plasmid-borne plcA gene, and expressing functional PI-PLC, are able to grow intracellularly in what appear to be phagolysosomes, although between 3 and 6 h is needed for this to manifest itself. Intracellular growth specifically in L. innocua may be a secondary function associated with the plcA gene product. The addition of this one gene, plcA, to a species of Listeria that in the wild-type state does not replicate intracellularly apparently can now allow some of the bacteria to transiently multiply inside the phagosomes of host macrophage cells.},

While fluorescent proteins typically bleach at a substantially slower rate than many small molecule dyes, lack of photostability remains an important limiting factor for experiments requiring large numbers of images of single cells. Screening methods focusing solely on brightness or wavelength are highly effective in optimizing both properties, but the absence of selective pressure for photostability in such screens leads to unpredictable photobleaching behavior in the resulting fluorescent proteins. Here, we describe an assay for screening libraries of fluorescent proteins for enhanced photostability. With this assay, we developed highly photostable variants of mOrange (a wavelength-shifted monomeric derivative of DsRed from Discosoma sp.) and TagRFP (a monomeric derivative of eqFP578 from Entacmaea quadricolor) that maintain most of the beneficial qualities of the original proteins and perform as reliably as Aequorea victoria GFP derivatives in fusion constructs.},

Interactions between cadherin ectodomains from apposed cells mediate cell\textendash cell contact, whereas the intracellular region functionally links cadherins to the underlying cytoskeleton. Structural, biophysical, and biochemical studies have provided important insights into the mechanism and specificity of cell\textendash cell adhesion by classical cadherins and their interplay with the cytoskeleton. Adhesive binding arises through exchange of {$\beta$} strands between the first extracellular cadherin domains (EC1) of partner cadherins from adjacent cells. This ``strand-swap'' binding mode is common to classical and desmosomal cadherins, but sequence alignments suggest that other cadherins will bind differently. The intracellular region of classical cadherins binds to p120 and {$\beta$}-catenin, and {$\beta$}-catenin binds to the F-actin binding protein {$\alpha$}-catenin. Rather than stably bridging {$\beta$}-catenin to actin, it appears that {$\alpha$}-catenin actively regulates the actin cytoskeleton at cadherin-based cell\textendash cell contacts., Cadherins on neighboring cells adhere to each other by ``strand swapping.'' Catenins were thought to link cadherins to actin but may instead have a regulatory role.},

  abstract = {Macrophage activation often contributes to the strong immune response elicited upon infection. The ability of macrophages to become activated was discovered when sub-lethal primary infections of mice with the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes provided protection against secondary infections through nonhumoral immunity. L. monocytogenes infect and propagate in macrophages by escaping the phagosome into the cytosol, where they avoid humoral immune mediators. Activated macrophages kill L. monocytogenes by blocking phagosomal escape. The timing of the antimicrobial activities within the phagosome is crucial to the outcome. In non-activated macrophages, bacterial factors generally prevail, and L. monocytogenes can escape from the vacuoles and grow within cytoplasm. Activated macrophages generate reactive oxygen or nitrogen intermediates early after bacterial uptake, which prevent the bacteria from escaping vacuoles into cytoplasm. The heterogeneity in the interactions between L. monocytogenes and the macrophage indicate a complex relationship between the host and the pathogen governed by chemistries that promote and inhibit escape from vacuoles. This review examines the mechanisms used by activated and non-activated macrophages to kill microbes, and how those mechanisms are employed against L. monocytogenes.},

  abstract = {Flagellar motility is an essential mechanism by which bacteria adapt to and survive in diverse environments. Although flagella confer an advantage to many bacterial pathogens for colonization during infection, bacterial flagellins also stimulate host innate immune responses. Consequently, many bacterial pathogens down-regulate flagella production following initial infection. Listeria monocytogenes is a facultative intracellular pathogen that represses transcription of flagellar motility genes at physiological temperatures (37\textdegree C and above). Temperature-dependent expression of flagellar motility genes is mediated by the opposing activities of MogR, a DNA-binding transcriptional repressor, and DegU, a response regulator that functions as an indirect antagonist of MogR. In this study, we identify an additional component of the molecular circuitry governing temperature-dependent flagellar gene expression. At low temperatures (30\textdegree C and below), MogR repression activity is specifically inhibited by an anti-repressor, GmaR. We demonstrate that GmaR forms a stable complex with MogR, preventing MogR from binding its DNA target sites. GmaR anti-repression activity is temperature dependent due to DegU-dependent transcriptional activation of gmaR at low temperatures. Thus, GmaR production represents the first committed step for flagella production in L. monocytogenes. Interestingly, GmaR also functions as a glycosyltransferase exhibiting O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT) activity for flagellin (FlaA). GmaR is the first OGT to be identified and characterized in prokaryotes that specifically {$\beta$}-O-GlcNAcylates a prokaryotic protein. Unlike the well-characterized, highly conserved OGT regulatory protein in eukaryotes, the catalytic activity of GmaR is functionally separable from its anti-repression function. These results establish GmaR as the first known example of a bifunctional protein that transcriptionally regulates expression of its enzymatic substrate.},

In Listeria monocytogenes, MogR tightly represses expression of flagellin (FlaA) during extracellular growth at 37 \textdegree C and during intracellular infection. MogR is also required for full virulence in a murine model of infection. Using in vitro and in vivo infection models, we determined that the severe virulence defect of MogR-negative bacteria is due to overexpression of FlaA. Specifically, overproduction of FlaA in MogR-negative bacteria caused pleiotropic defects in bacterial division (chaining phenotype), intracellular spread, and virulence in mice. DNA binding and microarray analyses revealed that MogR represses transcription of all known flagellar motility genes by binding directly to a minimum of two TTTT-N5-AAAA recognition sites positioned within promoter regions such that RNA polymerase binding is occluded. Analysis of MogR protein levels demonstrated that modulation of MogR repression activity confers the temperature-specificity to flagellar motility gene expression. Epistasis analysis revealed that MogR repression of transcription is antagonized in a temperature-dependent manner by the DegU response regulator and that DegU further regulates FlaA levels through a posttranscriptional mechanism. These studies provide the first known example to our knowledge of a transcriptional repressor functioning as a master regulator controlling nonhierarchal expression of flagellar motility genes., Bacteria move in liquid environments using hair-like structures on their surface called flagella. Production of flagella requires more than 40 genes and a significant amount of energy. Indeed, a single flagella filament is composed of approximately 20,000 flagellin subunits. In the environment, bacteria use flagella to swim toward nutrients. Flagella are also important for disease-causing bacteria (pathogens) to initiate infections. However, once inside a person, flagellin is a potent stimulator of the human immune system. Consequently, many bacteria decrease production of flagella shortly after infection. Listeria monocytogenes is a pathogen that grows inside of human cells. In this study, the authors show that L. monocytogenes produce a unique protein (MogR) that downregulates production of all of the genes required to produce flagella. This mode of flagella regulation has not been previously observed in bacteria. The authors demonstrate that in the absence of MogR, L. monocytogenes overproduce flagellin. Misregulation of flagellin production results in bacteria that are no longer able to efficiently enter host cells and are less pathogenic. Thus, the authors demonstrate that MogR-dependent repression of flagellin production is essential for L. monocytogenes to grow inside of host cells.},

  abstract = {Listeriolysin O (LLO) and ActA are essential virulence determinants for Listeria monocytogenes pathogenesis. Transcription of actA and hly, encoding LLO, is regulated by PrfA and increases dramatically during intracellular infection. The 5\textcent{} untranslated regions (5\textcent{} UTRs) of actA and prfA have been shown to upregulate expression of their respective gene products. Here, we demonstrate that the hly 5\textcent{} UTR plays a critical role in regulating expression of LLO during intracellular infection. Deletion of the hly 5\textcent{} UTR, while retaining the hly ribosome binding site, had a moderate effect on LLO production during growth in broth culture, yet resulted in a marked decrease in LLO levels during intracellular infection. The diminished level of LLO resulted in a significant defect in bacterial cell-to-cell spread during intracellular infection and a 10-fold reduction in virulence during in vivo infection of mice. Insertion of the hly 5\textcent{} UTR sequence between a heterologous promoter and reporter gene sequences indicated that the hly 5\textcent{} UTR functions independent of PrfA-mediated transcription and can enhance expression of cis-associated genes through a mechanism that appears to act at both a post-transcriptional and translational level. The ability of the hly 5\textcent{} UTR to increase gene expression can be exploited to achieve PrfA-independent complementation of virulence genes and high-level expression of single copy heterologous genes in L. monocytogenes.},

  abstract = {Background Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhimurium is a Gram-negative pathogen causing salmonellosis. Salmonella Typhimurium-targeting bacteriophages have been proposed as an alternative biocontrol agent to antibiotics. To further understand infection and interaction mechanisms between the host strains and the bacteriophages, the receptor diversity of these phages needs to be elucidated. Methodology/Principal Findings Twenty-five Salmonella phages were isolated and their receptors were identified by screening a Tn5 random mutant library of S. Typhimurium SL1344. Among them, three types of receptors were identified flagella (11 phages), vitamin B12 uptake outer membrane protein, BtuB (7 phages) and lipopolysaccharide-related O-antigen (7 phages). TEM observation revealed that the phages using flagella (group F) or BtuB (group B) as a receptor belong to Siphoviridae family, and the phages using O-antigen of LPS as a receptor (group L) belong to Podoviridae family. Interestingly, while some of group F phages (F-I) target FliC host receptor, others (F-II) target both FliC and FljB receptors, suggesting that two subgroups are present in group F phages. Cross-resistance assay of group B and L revealed that group L phages could not infect group B phage-resistant strains and reversely group B phages could not infect group L SPN9TCW-resistant strain. Conclusions/Significance In this report, three receptor groups of 25 newly isolated S. Typhimurium-targeting phages were determined. Among them, two subgroups of group F phages interact with their host receptors in different manner. In addition, the host receptors of group B or group L SPN9TCW phages hinder other group phage infection, probably due to interaction between receptors of their groups. This study provides novel insights into phage-host receptor interaction for Salmonella phages and will inform development of optimal phage therapy for protection against Salmonella.},

  abstract = {Filamentous actinobacteria are widely used as microbial cell factories to produce valuable secondary metabolites, including the vast majority of clinically relevant antimicrobial compounds. Secondary metabolites are typically encoded by large biosynthetic gene clusters, which allow for a modular approach to generating diverse compounds through recombination. Protoplast fusion is a popular method for whole genome recombination that uses fusion of cells that are transiently wall-deficient. This process has been applied for both inter- and intraspecies recombination. An important limiting step in obtaining diverse recombinants from fused protoplasts is regeneration of the cell wall, because this forces the chromosomes from different parental lines to segregate, thereby preventing further recombination. Recently, several labs have gained insight into wall-deficient bacteria that have the ability to proliferate without their cell wall, known as L-forms. Unlike protoplasts, L-forms can stably maintain multiple chromosomes over many division cycles. Fusion of such L-forms would potentially allow cells to express genes from both parental genomes while also extending the time for recombination, both of which can contribute to an increased chemical diversity. Here, we present a perspective on how L-form fusion has the potential to become a platform for novel compound discovery and may thus help to overcome the antibiotic discovery void.},

  abstract = {Background: Atypical chemokine receptor 3 (ACKR3, synonym CXCR7) is increasingly considered relevant in neuroinflammatory conditions, in which its upregulation contributes to compromised endothelial barrier function and may ultimately allow inflammatory brain injury. While an impact of ACKR3 has been recognized in several neurological autoimmune diseases, neuroinflammation may also result from infectious agents, including Ureaplasma species (spp.). Although commonly regarded as commensals of the adult urogenital tract, Ureaplasma spp. may cause invasive infections in immunocompromised adults as well as in neonates and appear to be relevant pathogens in neonatal meningitis. Nonetheless, clinical and in vitro data on Ureaplasma-induced inflammation are scarce. Methods: We established a cell culture model of Ureaplasma meningitis, aiming to analyze ACKR3 variances as a possible pathomechanism in Ureaplasma-associated neuroinflammation. Non-immortalized human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) were exposed to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or tumor necrosis factor-{$\alpha$} (TNF-{$\alpha$}), and native as well as LPS-primed HBMEC were cultured with Ureaplasma urealyticum serovar 8 (Uu8) and U. parvum serovar 3 (Up3). ACKR3 responses were assessed via qRT-PCR, RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, and immunocytochemistry. Results: LPS, TNF-{$\alpha$}, and Ureaplasma spp. influenced ACKR3 expression in HBMEC. LPS and TNF-{$\alpha$} significantly induced ACKR3 mRNA expression (p {$<$} 0.001, vs. control), whereas Ureaplasma spp. enhanced ACKR3 protein expression in HBMEC (p {$<$} 0.01, vs. broth control). Co-stimulation with LPS and either Ureaplasma isolate intensified ACKR3 responses (p {$<$} 0.05, vs. LPS). Furthermore, stimulation wielded a differential influence on the receptor's ligands. Conclusions: We introduce an in vitro model of Ureaplasma meningitis. We are able to demonstrate a proinflammatory capacity of Ureaplasma spp. in native and, even more so, in LPS-primed HBMEC, underlining their clinical relevance particularly in a setting of co-infection. Furthermore, our data may indicate a novel role for ACKR3, with an impact not limited to auto-inflammatory diseases, but extending to infection-related neuroinflammation as well. AKCR3-induced blood-brain barrier breakdown might constitute a potential common pathomechanism.},

  abstract = {The culture of fastidious microorganisms is a critical step in infectious disease studies. As a proof-of-concept experiment, we evaluated an empirical medium containing eukaryotic cell extracts for its ability to support the growth of Coxiella burnetii. Here, we demonstrate the exponential growth of several bacterial strains, including the C. burnetii Nine Mile phase I and phase II strains, and C. burnetii isolates from humans and animals. Low-oxygen-tension conditions and the presence of small hydrophilic molecules and short peptides were critical for facilitating growth. Moreover, bacterial antigenicity was conserved, revealing the potential for this culture medium to be used in diagnostic tests and in the elaboration of vaccines against C. burnetii. We were also able to grow the majority of previously tested intracellular and fastidious bacterial species, including Tropheryma whipplei, Mycobacterium bovis, Leptospira spp., Borrelia spp., and most putative bioterrorism agents. However, we were unable to culture Rickettsia africae and Legionella spp. in this medium. The versatility of this medium should encourage its use as a replacement for the cell-based culture systems currently used for growing several facultative and putative intracellular bacterial species.},

  abstract = {Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive, intracellular, food-borne pathogen that can cause severe illness in humans and animals. On infection, it is actively phagocytosed by macrophages; it then escapes from the phagosome, replicates in the cytosol, and subsequently spreads from cell to cell by a non-lytic mechanism driven by actin polymerization. Penetration of the phagosomal membrane is initiated by the secreted haemolysin listeriolysin O (LLO), which is essential for vacuolar escape in vitro and for virulence in animal models of infection. Reduction is required to activate the lytic activity of LLO in vitro, and we show here that reduction by the enzyme {$\gamma$}-interferon-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT, also called Ifi30) is responsible for the activation of LLO in vivo. GILT is a soluble thiol reductase expressed constitutively within the lysosomes of antigen-presenting cells, and it accumulates in macrophage phagosomes as they mature into phagolysosomes. The enzyme is delivered by a mannose-6-phosphate receptor-dependent mechanism to the endocytic pathway, where amino- and carboxy-terminal pro-peptides are cleaved to generate a 30-kDa mature enzyme. The active site of GILT contains two cysteine residues in a CXXC motif that catalyses the reduction of disulphide bonds. Mice lacking GILT are deficient in generating major histocompatibility complex class-II-restricted CD4+ T-cell responses to protein antigens that contain disulphide bonds. Here we show that these mice are resistant to L. monocytogenes infection. Replication of the organism in GILT-negative macrophages, or macrophages expressing an enzymatically inactive GILT mutant, is impaired because of delayed escape from the phagosome. GILT activates LLO within the phagosome by the thiol reductase mechanism shared by members of the thioredoxin family. In addition, purified GILT activates recombinant LLO, facilitating membrane permeabilization and red blood cell lysis. The data show that GILT is a critical host factor that facilitates L. monocytogenes infection.},

  abstract = {Objective/background: Cell wall-deficient bacterial forms (L-forms) may occur along with resistance to factors that trigger their appearance. It is of interest to study the relationship between the L-form transformation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the exhibition of drug tolerance to ethambutol (EMB), an inhibitor of cell wall synthesis. Methods: L-form variant was produced from a sensitive EMB strain of M. tuberculosis through a cryogenic stress treatment protocol and was subsequently cultivated in Middlebrook 7H9 semisolid medium, containing EMB in a minimal inhibitory concentration of 2 mg/L. Susceptibility to EMB of the parental strain and its L-form variant was evaluated phenotypically and using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay targeting a mutation in the embB306 gene fragment. Results: In contrast to the sensitivity to EMB of the parental strain, its L-form variant showed phenotypic resistance to high concentrations of EMB (16 mg/L), but the mutation in embB306 was not found. Electron microscopy observation of the L-form variant showed a heterogenic population of bacteria, with different degrees of cell wall deficiency, as well as cells of protoplastic type without cell walls. Of special interest were the observed capsule-like structures around the L-form cells and the biofilm-like matrix produced by the L-form population. Conclusion: We suggest that the expression of phenotypic resistance to EMB in M. tuberculosis can be associated with alterations or loss of cell walls in L-form bacteria, respectively, which results in a lack of a specific target for EMB action. In addition, production of capsule-like structures and biofilm matrix by L-forms could contribute to their resistance and survival in the presence of antibacterial agents.},

The `salt in cytoplasm' approach, which requires extensive structural modifications, is restricted mainly to members of the Halobacteriaceae. All other species have convergently evolved to cope with environments of elevated osmolarity by the accumulation of a restricted range of low molecular mass molecules, termed compatible solutes owing to their compatibility with cellular processes at high internal concentrations. Herein we review the molecular mechanisms governing the accumulation of these compounds, both in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, focusing specifically on the regulation of their transport/synthesis systems and the ability of these systems to sense and respond to changes in the osmolarity of the extracellular environment. Finally, we examine the current knowledge on the role of these osmostress responsive systems in contributing to the virulence potential of a number of pathogenic bacteria.},

With the exception of intensively studied viral infections such as HIV/AIDs, little is known about the extent to which the clonal expansion that occurs during long-term infection by pathogens involves important genetic adaptations. We report here a detailed, whole-genome analysis of one such infection, that of a cystic fibrosis (CF) patient by the opportunistic bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The bacteria underwent numerous genetic adaptations during 8 years of infection, as evidenced by a positive-selection signal across the genome and an overwhelming signal in specific genes, several of which are mutated during the course of most CF infections. Of particular interest is our finding that virulence factors that are required for the initiation of acute infections are often selected against during chronic infections. It is apparent that the genotypes of the P. aeruginosa strains present in advanced CF infections differ systematically from those of ``wild-type'' P. aeruginosa and that these differences may offer new opportunities for treatment of this chronic disease.},

Mechanisms of tetrazolium reduction to formazan in eukaryotic cells have been proposed, however those in prokaryotes remain largely unresolved. We undertook studies to determine the sites, and degree of coupling for INT and CTC reduction in the aerobic Escherichia coli K-12 respiratory chain using both intact cells and inverted membrane vesicles. In addition, reduction in whole cells was assayed under anaerobic conditions which elicit different electron transport pathways. Results of experiments with inhibitors of specific electron transport components indicated that both CTC and INT were reduced prior to ubiquinone in the E. coli respiratory chain by the primary aerobic [succinate and NAD(P)H] dehydrogenases. INT was also reduced at ubiquinone and possibly cytochromes b555, 556. Quantitative CTC reduction was more closely correlated with respiration in whole cells than INT, but the reverse was true in inverted membrane vesicles. Both tetrazolium salts were reduced to significant degrees under anaerobic conditions, particularly glucose fermentation. Mid-point reduction potential of CTC was determined to be -200 mV by redox titration. However, it appears that CTC forms a weakly fluorescent, poorly-localized intracellular formazan at redox potentials higher than ca. -200 mV. Inhibition of the aerobic terminal oxidases with KCN or azide strongly increased INT-, but significantly decreased CTC reduction in whole cells, indicating that these agents may not be useful for optimizing CTC-formazan or CTC (+) cell numbers in some bacteria. However, several other chemical agents stimulated CTC and INT reduction. These results suggest strategies for optimizing methods using these tetrazolium salts for assessment of bacterial respiratory activity.},

For example, dedicated enzymes accurately dictate the site of post-translational modifications in signaling proteins, and ribosomes precisely link the C-terminal carboxylic acid of one unprotected amino acid with the N-terminal amino group of the other amino acid through spatially confined proximity. For many years, chemists have been striving to achieve site selectivity on biomolecules by mimicking nature. Driven by the development of chemoselective protein conjugation reactions, enzymology and protein\textendash protein interactions, the past decade has witnessed a boom in site-selective protein conjugation reactions. (In this review, a site-selective protein conjugation reaction is defined as an organic reaction that targets a single amino acid instead of a kind of amino acids in a protein or a proteome under physiological conditions, for example, a single cysteine residue among all of the cysteines.) In this review, we summarize the recent advancements of bioconjugation reactions that demonstrate this feature of precise site selectivity, focusing on the reactions of the proteinogenic amino acids (excluding those at non-coded or non-proteinogenic amino acids that are introduced to proteins through genetic manipulations).},

Intracellular infection is a consequence of the bacterium's capacity to enter a wide variety of mammalian cells, to not only survive but also replicate therein, and to its faculty to spread from one cell to the next, thereby escaping the humoral immune response. Here, we review both the well-established and the newly discovered strategies used by this bacterium to achieve this intracellular lifestyle while escaping from the host innate immune response.

As such, the three prolyl hydroxylases (prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing protein (PHD) 1, PHD2 and PHD3) and the asparagyl hydroxylase (factor inhibiting HIF (FIH)-1) act as cellular oxygen sensors. In addition to erythropoiesis, HIF-1 regulates a broad range of physiologically relevant genes involved in angiogenesis, apoptosis, vasomotor control and energy metabolism. Therefore, the HIF system is implicated in the pathophysiology of many human diseases. * 4In addition to the tight regulation by oxygen tension, temporal and tissue-specific signals limit expression of the EPO gene primarily to the fetal liver and the adult kidney.},

  abstract = {The bacterial cytoplasmic membrane is composed of roughly equal proportions of lipids and proteins. The main lipid components are phospholipids, which vary in acyl chain length, saturation, and branching and carry head groups that vary in size and charge. Phospholipid variants determine membrane properties such as fluidity and charge that in turn modulate interactions with membrane-associated proteins. We summarize recent advances in understanding bacterial membrane structure and function, focusing particularly on the possible existence and significance of specialized membrane domains. We review the role of membrane curvature as a spatial cue for recruitment and regulation of proteins involved in morphogenic functions, especially elongation and division. Finally, we examine the role of the membrane, especially regulation of synthesis and fluid properties, in the life cycle of cell wall\textendash deficient L-form bacteria.

Currently, there are many specialized methods that can be used to extract pure biomolecules, such as solution-based and column-based protocols. Manual method has certainly come a long way over time with various commercial offerings which included complete kits containing most of the components needed to isolate nucleic acid, but most of them require repeated centrifugation steps, followed by removal of supernatants depending on the type of specimen and additional mechanical treatment. Automated systems designed for medium-to-large laboratories have grown in demand over recent years. It is an alternative to labor-intensive manual methods. The technology should allow a high throughput of samples; the yield, purity, reproducibility, and scalability of the biomolecules as well as the speed, accuracy, and reliability of the assay should be maximal, while minimizing the risk of cross-contamination.},

A systematic evaluation of suitable alternative materials and components for the simulation of DNA gel electrophoresis was undertaken. A tried and tested set of combinations is presented here for educators to use in hands-on classroom teaching, which does not require DNA, agarose, or Tris\textendash borate\textendash EDTA buffer. The use of common biological stains in place of DNA samples, agar\textendash agar-based gels, and weak electrolyte solutions provides a simple, inexpensive, and highly reproducible system that is adaptable to instructional needs. The migration of multicolored bands during electrophoresis provides an intuitive, compelling demonstration of the concept of electrophoresis.},

  abstract = {Despite the availability of the Populus genome sequence and the development of genetic, genomic, and transgenic approaches for its improvement, the lengthy life span of Populus and the cumbersome process required for its transformation have impeded rapid characterization of gene functions in Populus. Protoplasts provide a versatile and physiologically relevant cell system for high-through- put analysis and functional characterization of plant genes. Here, a highly efficient transient expression system using Populus mesophyll protoplasts was developed based on the following three steps. The first step involved formulating a new enzyme cocktail containing 2 \% Cellulase C2605 and 0.5 \% Pectinase P2611, which was shown to enable effi- cient large-scale isolation of homogenous Populus meso- phyll protoplasts. The second step involved optimization of transfection conditions, such as the polyethylene glycol concentration and amount of plasmid DNA to ensure a [80 \% transfection efficiency for Populus protoplasts. The third step involved using the Populus protoplast transient expression system to successfully determine the subcellular localizations of proteins, emulate signaling events during Biyue Tan and Meng Xu contributed equally to this work.

  abstract = {Listeria monocytogenes is an important food-borne pathogen that can tolerate a wide range of stress conditions. However, its stress adaptation processes are still poorly understood. Real-time-based quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) provides a tool to probe gene expression changes underlying stress adaptation. But, a limitation to study mRNA levels by real-time qRT-PCR is that validated reference genes are required for normalization. Such genes are currently lacking for experimental models that may be applied to evaluate stress-related gene expression changes in L. monocytogenes. Therefore, five housekeeping genes (HKG) were studied as potential reference genes. Their expression stability was evaluated across 16 L. monocytogenes strains. Three experimental models designed to assess gene expression changes induced by cold, acid and high NaCl concentration stress adaptation were applied. The 16S rRNA gene was consistently the most stably expressed HKG across the different L. monocytogenes strains under all the experimental conditions. While the expressions of {$\beta$}-glucosidase (bglA), Glyceraldehyde-3P-dehydrogenase (gap), RNA polymerase beta subunit (rpoB) and Ribosomal protein L4 (rplD) was stable amongst the different L. monocytogenes strains, they were prone to significant variations under the different stress adaptation models.},

Key search terms included Li steria monocytogenes, food-borne illness, penicillins, fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins, and vancomycin.DATA SYNTHESIS:Listeriosis is mainly a food-borne illness caused by L. monocytogenes;people most prone to the disease are pregnant women, newborns, elderly, and those with HIV or other diseases compromising immunity. Listeria infections are associated with a high mortality rate, and thus effective antibiotic treatment is essential. Although a variety of antibiotics have activity against the organism, ampicillin alone or in combination with gentamicin remains the treatment of choice. Some patients may require alternative therapies due to allergies or certain disease states. Second-line agents for these cases include trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin, vancomycin, and the fluoroquinolones. Cephalosporins are not active against Listeria.CONCLUSIONS:Ampicillin is currently the drug of choice for treating L. monocytogenes infections. Many antibiotics have been shown to be effective and are used as second-line agents. However, further study is required for some of the most recently introduced antibiotics, such as the fluoroquinolones, to determine their place in the treatment of Listeriainfections.},

They thrust cells in liquids (swimming) or on surfaces (swarming) so that cells can move toward favorable environments. At the base of each flagellum, a reversible rotary motor, which is powered by the proton- or the sodium-motive force, is embedded in the cell envelope. The motor consists of two parts: the rotating part, or rotor, that is connected to the hook and the filament, and the nonrotating part, or stator, that conducts coupling ion and is responsible for energy conversion. Intensive genetic and biochemical studies of the flagellum have been conducted in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, and more than 50 gene products are known to be involved in flagellar assembly and function. The energy-coupling mechanism, however, is still not known. In this chapter, we survey our current knowledge of the flagellar system, based mostly on studies from Salmonella, E. coli, and marine species Vibrio alginolyticus, supplemented with distinct aspects of other bacterial species revealed by recent studies.},

  abstract = {The covalent anchoring of surface proteins to the cell wall envelope of Gram-positive bacteria occurs by a universal mechanism requiring sortases, extracellular transpeptidases that are positioned in the plasma membrane. Surface protein precursors are first initiated into the secretory pathway of Gram-positive bacteria via N-terminal signal peptides. C-terminal sorting signals of surface proteins, bearing an LPXTG motif or other recognition sequences, provide for sortase-mediated cleavage and acyl enzyme formation, a thioester linkage between the active site cysteine residue of sortase and the C-terminal carboxyl group of cleaved surface proteins. During cell wall anchoring, sortase acyl enzymes are resolved by the nucleophilic attack of peptidoglycan substrates, resulting in amide bond formation between the C-terminal end of surface proteins and peptidoglycan cross-bridges within the bacterial cell wall envelope. The genomes of Gram-positive bacteria encode multiple sortase genes. Recent evidence suggests that sortase enzymes catalyze protein anchoring reactions of multiple different substrate classes with different sorting signal motif sequences, protein linkage to unique cell wall anchor structures as well as protein polymerization leading to the formation of pili on the surface of Gram-positive bacteria.},

  abstract = {Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) is an invasive foodborne pathogen that leads to severe central nervous system and maternal-fetal infections. Lm ability to actively cross the intestinal barrier is one of its key pathogenic properties. Lm crosses the intestinal epithelium upon the interaction of its surface protein internalin (InlA) with its host receptor E-cadherin (Ecad). InlA-Ecad interaction is species-specific, does not occur in wild-type mice, but does in transgenic mice expressing human Ecad and knock-in mice expressing humanized mouse Ecad. To study listeriosis in wild-type mice, InlA has been ``murinized'' to interact with mouse Ecad. Here, we demonstrate that, unexpectedly, murinized InlA (InlAm) mediates not only Ecad-dependent internalization, but also N-cadherin-dependent internalization. Consequently, InlAm-expressing Lm targets not only goblet cells expressing luminally-accessible Ecad, as does Lm in humanized mice, but also targets villous M cells, which express luminally-accessible N-cadherin. This aberrant Lm portal of entry results in enhanced innate immune responses and intestinal barrier damage, both of which are not observed in wild-type Lm-infected humanized mice. Murinization of InlA therefore not only extends the host range of Lm, but also broadens its receptor repertoire, providing Lm with artifactual pathogenic properties. These results challenge the relevance of using InlAm-expressing Lm to study human listeriosis and in vivo host responses to this human pathogen., Co-evolution of microbes with their hosts can select stringently specific host-microbe interactions at the cell, tissue and species levels. Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) is a foodborne pathogen that causes a deadly systemic infection in humans. Lm crosses the intestinal epithelium upon the interaction of its surface protein InlA with E-cadherin (Ecad). InlA-Ecad interaction is species-specific, does not occur in wild-type mice, but does in transgenic mice expressing human Ecad and knock-in mice expressing humanized mouse Ecad. To study listeriosis in wild-type mice, InlA has been ``murinized'' to interact with mouse Ecad. Here, we demonstrate that in addition to interacting with mouse Ecad, InlAm also uses N-cadherin as a receptor, whereas InlA does not. This artifactual InlAm-N-cadherin interaction promotes bacterial translocation across villous M cells, a cell type which is not targeted by InlA-expressing bacteria. This leads to intestinal inflammation and intestinal barrier damage, both of which are not seen in humans and humanized mouse models permissive to InlA-Ecad interaction. These results challenge the relevance of using InlAm-expressing Lm as a model to study human listeriosis and host responses to this pathogen. They also illustrate that caution must be exercised before using ``murinized'' pathogens to study human infectious diseases.},

  abstract = {Interlocked molecular architectures are well known in supramolecular chemistry and are widely used for various applications like sensors, molecular machines and logic gates. The use of DNA for constructing these interlocked structures has increased significantly within the current decade. Because of Watson\textendash Crick base pairing rules, DNA is an excellent material for the self-assembly of well-defined interlocked nanoarchitectures. These DNA nanostructures exhibit sufficient stability, good solubility in aqueous media, biocompatibility, and can be easily combined with other biomolecules in bio-hybrid nano-assemblies. Therefore, the study of novel DNA-based interlocked systems is of interest for nanotechnology, synthetic biology, supramolecular chemistry, biotechnology, and for sensing purposes. Here we summarize recent developments and applications of interlocked supramolecular architectures made of DNA. Examples illustrating that these systems can be precisely controlled by switching on and off the molecular motion of its mechanically trapped components are discussed. Introducing different triggers into such systems creates molecular assemblies capable of performing logic gate operations and/or catalytic activity control. Interlocked DNA-based nanostructures thus represent promising frameworks for building increasingly complex and dynamic nanomachines with highly controllable functionality.},

In this medium, which does not contain any externally added polypeptide growth factor, cells proliferate rapidly with a doubling time of approximately equal to 10 hr. During exponential growth in this serum-free medium, Neuro-2A cells secrete a 15- to 20-kDa transforming growth factor with strong mitogenic action and the ability to induce anchorage-independent growth on nontransformed cells. This neuroblastoma-derived transforming growth factor (ND-TGF) is acid and heat stable but is sensitive to treatment with trypsin or dithiothreitol. However, it does not compete with epidermal growth factor (EGF) for receptor binding and does not require EGF receptors for its mitogenic activity. Experiments on the effects of EGF on ND-TGF-induced soft agar growth of normal rat kidney cells indicate that Neuro-2A cells secrete an EGF-potentiated TGF in addition to ND-TGF. It is suggested that Neuro-2A cells can proliferate in the absence of externally added growth factors as a result of autocrine production of polypeptide growth factors.},

It is also a desirable cloning host for the production of intact proteins, as it does not possess external alkaline proteases and can stably maintain a variety of plasmid vectors. Genetic tools for this species include transducing phages and several hundred mutants covering the processes of biosynthesis, catabolism, division, sporulation, germination, antibiotic resistance, and recombination. The seven plasmids of B. megaterium strain QM B1551 contain several unusual metabolic genes that may be useful in bioremediation. Recently, several recombinant shuttle vectors carrying different strong inducible promoters and various combinations of affinity tags for simple protein purification have been constructed. Leader sequences-mediated export of affinity-tagged proteins into the growth medium was made possible. These plasmids are commercially available. For a broader application of B. megaterium in industry, sporulation and protease-deficient as well as UV-sensitive mutants were constructed. The genome sequence of two different strains, plasmidless DSM319 and QM B1551 carrying seven natural plasmids, is now available. These sequences allow for a systems biotechnology optimization of the production host B. megaterium. Altogether, a ``toolbox'' of hundreds of genetically characterized strains, genetic methods, vectors, hosts, and genomic sequences make B. megaterium an ideal organism for industrial, environmental, and experimental applications.},

Clinical manifestations of invasive listeriosis are usually severe and include abortion, sepsis, and meningoencephalitis. Listeriosis can also manifest as a febrile gastroenteritis syndrome. In addition to humans, L. monocytogenes affects many vertebrate species, including birds. Listeria ivanovii, a second pathogenic species of the genus, is specific for ruminants. Our current view of the pathophysiology of listeriosis derives largely from studies with the mouse infection model. Pathogenic listeriae enter the host primarily through the intestine. The liver is thought to be their first target organ after intestinal translocation. In the liver, listeriae actively multiply until the infection is controlled by a cell-mediated immune response. This initial, subclinical step of listeriosis is thought to be common due to the frequent presence of pathogenic L. monocytogenes in food. In normal indivuals, the continual exposure to listerial antigens probably contributes to the maintenance of anti-Listeria memory T cells. However, in debilitated and immunocompromised patients, the unrestricted proliferation of listeriae in the liver may result in prolonged low-level bacteremia, leading to invasion of the preferred secondary target organs (the brain and the gravid uterus) and to overt clinical disease. L. monocytogenes and L. ivanovii are facultative intracellular parasites able to survive in macrophages and to invade a variety of normally nonphagocytic cells, such as epithelial cells, hepatocytes, and endothelial cells. In all these cell types, pathogenic listeriae go through an intracellular life cycle involving early escape from the phagocytic vacuole, rapid intracytoplasmic multiplication, bacterially induced actin-based motility, and direct spread to neighboring cells, in which they reinitiate the cycle. In this way, listeriae disseminate in host tissues sheltered from the humoral arm of the immune system. Over the last 15 years, a number of virulence factors involved in key steps of this intracellular life cycle have been identified. This review describes in detail the molecular determinants of Listeria virulence and their mechanism of action and summarizes the current knowledge on the pathophysiology of listeriosis and the cell biology and host cell responses to Listeria infection. This article provides an updated perspective of the development of our understanding of Listeria pathogenesis from the first molecular genetic analyses of virulence mechanisms reported in 1985 until the start of the genomic era of Listeria research.},

In normal cervix, E-cadherin was expressed on the cell membrane of basal and parabasal cells. Cytoplasmic staining was present in occasional basal cells only. In CIN, the presence and localization of cytoplasmic E-cadherin were found to be significantly correlated with the grade of the CIN lesion. In squamous cell carcinomas, reduced membranous and increased cytoplasmic staining was seen with worsening differentiation. Loss of membranous E-cadherin expression was also detected in 4/7 metastatic deposits. E-cadherin expression (120 kD form on Western blotting) was seen in human cervical carcinoma cell lines (HT3, ME180, C41, Caski) that maintained the ability to aggregate in a homotypic adhesion assay and showed a typical epithelial morphology. E-cadherin-negative cell lines (Hela, SiHa, C33A) did not show adhesion. HOG-1 was the only E-cadherin-negative cell line which showed a significant degree of cell\textendash cell aggregation. These data indicate that loss of membranous E-cadherin expression may represent one of the abnormalities underlying loss of cell polarity and differentiation which characterize CIN and invasive cervical cancer.},

  abstract = {The evolution of antibiotic resistance carries a fitness cost, expressed in terms of reduced competitive ability in the absence of antibiotics. This cost plays a key role in the dynamics of resistance by generating selection against resistance when bacteria encounter an antibiotic-free environment. Previous work has shown that the cost of resistance is highly variable, but the underlying causes remain poorly understood. Here, we use a meta-analysis of the published resistance literature to determine how the genetic basis of resistance influences its cost. We find that on average chromosomal resistance mutations carry a larger cost than acquiring resistance via a plasmid. This may explain why resistance often evolves by plasmid acquisition. Second, we find that the cost of plasmid acquisition increases with the breadth of its resistance range. This suggests a potentially important limit on the evolution of extensive multidrug resistance via plasmids. We also find that epistasis can significantly alter the cost of mutational resistance. Overall, our study shows that the cost of antimicrobial resistance can be partially explained by its genetic basis. It also highlights both the danger associated with plasmidborne resistance and the need to understand why resistance plasmids carry a relatively low cost.},

We critically examined changes of the hybridization conditions, kinetics of the hybridization, and posthybridization treatments. Intermediate probe concentrations, addition of detergent to the hybridization buffer, and a posthybridization washing step were found to increase the signal to noise ratio. We could demonstrate a linear correlation between growth rate and probe-conferred fluorescence of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas cepacia cells. Oligonucleotides labeled with multiple fluorochromes showed elevated levels of non-specific binding and therefore could not be used to lower the detection limits, which still restrict studies with fluorescing rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes to well-growing microbial cells.

This method used a pair of primers based on a unique region in the 16S rRNA sequence of L. monocytogenes, which were previously reported by us to yield a specific nucleic acid probe. Our method included use of a shorter denaturing time, a shorter annealing time, a rapid transition, and an increase in the number of cycles, resulting in good sensitivity. Just 3 h for PCR plus 1 h for electrophoresis was required. Additional time for DNA isolation and DNA hybridization was not needed. This method detected as few as 2 to 20 CFU of L. monocytogenes in pure cultures and as few as 4 to 40 CFU of L. monocytogenes in inoculated (10(8) CFU), diluted food samples. Seven of eight foods, including four poultry products, gave positive results. Only one food sample, soft cheese, gave interference.

  abstract = {Crude rRNA was isolated from Listeria monocytogenes, L. innocua, and L. ivanovii and sequenced by a reverse transcriptase method. Only two sequence regions were found to differ for L. monocytogenes versus L. innocua or L. ivanovii. Two oligonucleotide probes (RL-1 and RL-2) complementary to these two regions of rRNA of L. monocytogenes were synthesized. The RL-1 probe had one base while the RL-2 probe had two bases which differed for L. monocytogenes versus L. innocua and L. ivanovii. Use of a dried gel hybridization in place of Northern (RNA) hybridization or dot blot hybridization indicated that the RL-2 probe hybridized with all 36 strains of L. monocytogenes tested but not with 6 other Listeria species and 11 other bacteria tested. The RL-2 probe is specific for L. monocytogenes, while the RL-1 probe showed some cross-reactions with other Listeria species. An alkaline phosphatase-labeled RL-2 probe could be used in a dot blot hybridization test and gave good results, but a 32P-labeled RL-2 probe was more sensitive than the nonradioactive probe and the 32P-labeled probe was useable for up to 2 months, even though the 32P was highly degenerated.},

Rational engineering and introduction of trackable genetic modifications using synthetic biology tools, coupled with high-throughput screening are, however, also efficient approaches to relieve bottlenecks hindering high-level protein production.

  abstract = {Flagellin is the structural component of flagella produced by many pathogenic bacteria and is a potent proinflammatory molecule that mediates these effects through Toll-like receptor (TLR) 5. In Listeria monocytogenes (LM), flagellin expression is regulated by temperature and has been described as being shut off at 37\textdegree C. In this study, we demonstrate that TLR5-mediated cell activation and flagellin expression is maintained at 37\textdegree C in some laboratory-adapted strains and in {$\approx\mkern1mu$}20\% of LM clinical isolates. To determine the role of flagellin in LM infection, a targeted mutation in the structural gene for flagellin (flaA) was generated in a parental LM strain that expressed flagellin under all conditions examined. In vitro studies demonstrated that this {$\Delta$}flaA mutant was (i) non-motile; (ii) not able to activate TLR5-transfected HeLa cells; and (iii) induced tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-{$\alpha$} production in {$\approx\mkern1mu$}50\% fewer CD11b+ cells in splenocytes from normal mice compared with the parental strain. However, there was no significant alteration in virulence of the {$\Delta$}flaA mutant after either intravenous or oral murine infection. Similarly, there was no difference in the generation of LM-specific CD8 or CD4 T cells after intravenous or oral infection. These data indicate that flagellin is not essential for LM pathogenesis or for the induction of LM-specific adaptive immune responses in normal mice.},

In addition to these five mycoplasma groups, a sixth group of variously named gram-positive, walled organisms (which included lactobacilli, clostridia, and other organisms) was also included in the overall phylogenetic unit. In each of these six primary groups, subgroups were readily recognized and defined.

  abstract = {Listeria monocytogenes has evolved the ability to exploit its host's actin cytoskeleton to power movement within and between cells without exiting from the cell, enabling it to evade the immune response. This remarkable adaptation requires the expression of a single bacterial surface protein, called ActA, that performs two key functions. It activates the host Arp2/3 complex, which promotes the nucleation of actin filaments at the bacterial surface and the organization of filaments into branched networks. Moreover, it recruits host Ena/VASP proteins and profilin, which stimulate actin filament elongation. Together these cellular factors promote the assembly of actin comet tails that recruit additional host cytoskeletal proteins that control filament bundling, terminate polymerization, and promote depolymerization. The assembly of the comet tail is essential for coupling actin polymerization to the force that drives bacterial propulsion. The process of bacterial motility can be reconstituted in vitro, facilitating a relatively complete understanding of the biochemical and biophysical mechanisms of actin polymerization and force generation. This chapter presents a review of the experiments that have led to our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of L. monocytogenes' motility and spread.},

  abstract = {A paradigm shift with potentially profound implications has been taking place over the past 3 decades. The convergence of research in diverse disciplines points to life being a cosmic phenomenon. A near-infinite information content of life appears to have evolved on a cosmological scale over vast distances, and enormous spans of time. It appears highly unlikely that life could have emerged from chemicals in ``some warm little pond'' on the Earth; in contrast we maintain that every species of life on the Earth, including Homo sapiens, is in essence the result of an assembly of cosmologically derived viral genes. The ingress of such genes that continues to the present day led to their accommodation within the genomes of evolving lineages, sifted according to the ``natural processes of selection'', a mechanism first enunciated by Patrick Matthews and later used by Darwin. The evidence for this point of view has now grown to the point where we believe, it will soon need to be accepted by the majority of the scientific community. This is particularly critical, since we suggest that new diseases capable of threatening Man's existence could arrive to Earth from space. Moreover, we need to understand that we must live in harmony with the Earth and its ever-changing biosphere if we are to coexist with it.},

Shigella flexneri is a Gram-negative enteroinvasive pathogen controlled by neutrophils. In this study, we use a Shigella-zebrafish (Danio rerio) infection model to investigate emergency granulopoiesis in vivo. We show that stem cell-driven neutrophil production occurs in response to Shigella infection and requires macrophage-independent signaling by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (Gcsf). To test whether emergency granulopoiesis can function beyond homoeostasis to enhance innate immunity, we developed a reinfection assay using zebrafish larvae that have not yet developed an adaptive immune system. Strikingly, larvae primed with a sublethal dose of Shigella are protected against a secondary lethal dose of Shigella in a type III secretion system (T3SS)-dependent manner. Collectively, these results highlight a new role for emergency granulopoiesis in boosting host defense and demonstrate that zebrafish larvae can be a valuable in vivo model to investigate innate immune memory.IMPORTANCE Shigella is an important human pathogen of the gut. Emergency granulopoiesis is the enhanced production of neutrophils by hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) upon infection and is widely considered a homoeostatic mechanism for replacing exhausted leukocytes. In this study, we developed a Shigella-zebrafish infection model to investigate stem cell-driven emergency granulopoiesis. We discovered that zebrafish initiate granulopoiesis in response to Shigella infection, via macrophage-independent signaling of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (Gcsf). Strikingly, larvae primed with a sublethal dose of Shigella are protected against a secondary lethal dose of Shigella in a type III secretion system (T3SS)-dependent manner. Taken together, we show that zebrafish infection can be used to capture Shigella-mediated stem cell-driven granulopoiesis and provide a new model system to study stem cell biology in vivo. Our results also highlight the potential of manipulating stem cell-driven granulopoiesis to boost innate immunity and combat infectious disease.},

Immunoglobulin A (IgA), as the principal antibody class in the secretions that bathe these mucosal surfaces, acts as an important first line of defence. IgA, also an important serum immunoglobulin, mediates a variety of protective functions through interaction with specific receptors and immune mediators. The importance of such protection is underlined by the fact that certain pathogens have evolved mechanisms to compromise IgA-mediated defence, providing an opportunity for more effective invasion. IgA function may also be perturbed in certain disease states, some of which are characterized by deposition of IgA in specific tissues.

  abstract = {Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen that invades mammalian cells and escapes from membrane-bound vacuoles to replicate within the host cell cytosol. Gene products required for intracellular bacterial growth and bacterial spread to adjacent cells are regulated by a transcriptional activator known as PrfA. PrfA becomes activated following L. monocytogenes entry into host cells, however the signal that stimulates PrfA activation has not yet been defined. Here we provide evidence for L. monocytogenes secretion of a small peptide pheromone, pPplA, which enhances the escape of L. monocytogenes from host cell vacuoles and may facilitate PrfA activation. The pPplA pheromone is generated via the proteolytic processing of the PplA lipoprotein secretion signal peptide. While the PplA lipoprotein is dispensable for pathogenesis, bacteria lacking the pPplA pheromone are significantly attenuated for virulence in mice and have a reduced efficiency of bacterial escape from the vacuoles of nonprofessional phagocytic cells. Mutational activation of PrfA restores virulence and eliminates the need for pPplA-dependent signaling. Experimental evidence suggests that the pPplA peptide may help signal to L. monocytogenes its presence within the confines of the host cell vacuole, stimulating the expression of gene products that contribute to vacuole escape and facilitating PrfA activation to promote bacterial growth within the cytosol., Experimental evidence has established that bacteria do not always exist as isolated single celled organisms, but instead communicate with each other through the secretion of small molecules that enable individual cells to coordinate complex traits and behaviors. Gram-positive bacteria rely on the secretion of small peptide pheromones to coordinate activities that include biofilm formation, exogenous DNA uptake via competence mechanisms, conjugal transfer of plasmid DNA, and expression of gene products that promote bacterial virulence. Here we provide evidence of a novel use of bacterial peptide pheromone signaling, that being the use of the pPplA peptide by L. monocytogenes to detect the confines of host cell vacuoles. Secretion and import of pPplA is required for efficient escape of L. monocytogenes from its initial membrane-bound host cell compartment, and bacteria lacking the peptide pheromone are severely attenuated for virulence in mice. The pPplA peptide pheromone is thus used by individual bacteria within a confined membrane bound space to coordinate the expression of gene products required by L. monocytogenes for intracellular growth and survival.},

FtsZ polymerizes at the future division site to form a ring-like structure, termed the Z-ring, that serves as a scaffold to recruit all other division proteins, and possibly generates force to constrict the cell. The scaffolding function of the Z-ring is well established, but the force generating function has recently been called into question. Additionally, new findings have demonstrated that the Z-ring is more directly linked to cell wall metabolism than simply recruiting enzymes to the division site. Here we review these advances and suggest that rather than generating a rate-limiting constrictive force, the Z-ring's function may be redefined as an orchestrator of septum synthesis.},

However, current techniques for plastic embedding are limited in their ability to preserve fluorescence while remaining suitable for micro-optical sectioning tomography of large-volume samples. In this study, we quantitatively evaluated the fluorescence preservation and penetration time of several commonly used resins in a Thy1-eYFP-H transgenic whole mouse brain, including glycol methacrylate (GMA), LR White, hydroxypropyl methacrylate (HPMA) and Unicryl. We found that HMPA embedding doubled the eYFP fluorescence intensity but required long durations of incubation for whole brain penetration. GMA, Unicryl and LR White each penetrated the brain rapidly but also led to variable quenching of eYFP fluorescence. Among the fast-penetrating resins, GMA preserved fluorescence better than LR White and Unicryl. We found that we could optimize the GMA formulation by reducing the polymerization temperature, removing 4-methoxyphenol and adjusting the pH of the resin solution to be alkaline. By optimizing the GMA formulation, we increased percentage of eYFP fluorescence preservation in GMA-embedded brains nearly two-fold. These results suggest that modified GMA is suitable for embedding large-volume tissues such as whole mouse brain and provide a novel approach for visualizing brain-wide networks.},

However, with a packaging size of {$<$}5 kb, applications have been limited to relatively small disease genes. Based on the finding that AAV genomes undergo intermolecular circular concatamerization after transduction in muscle, we have developed a paradigm to increase the size of delivered transgenes with this vector through trans-splicing between two independent vectors coadministered to the same tissue. When two vectors encoding either the 5{${'}$} or 3{${'}$} portions of the erythropoietin genomic locus were used, functional erythropoietin protein was expressed in muscle subsequent to the formation of intermolecular circular concatamers in a head-to-tail orientation through trans-splicing between these two independent vector genomes. These findings will allow for the application of AAV technologies to a wider variety of diseases for which therapeutic transgenes exceed the packaging limitation of present AAV vectors.},

The expression of these genes is controlled by ManR, a LevR-type transcription activator containing two PTS regulation domains (PRDs) and two PTS-like domains (enzyme IIAMan [EIIAMan]- and EIIBGat-like). We demonstrate here that in Listeria monocytogenes, ManR is activated via the phosphorylation of His585 in the EIIAMan-like domain by the general PTS components enzyme I and HPr. We also show that ManR is regulated by the PTSMpo and that EIIBMpo plays a dual role in ManR regulation. First, yeast two-hybrid experiments revealed that unphosphorylated EIIBMpo interacts with the two C-terminal domains of ManR (EIIBGat-like and PRD2) and that this interaction is required for ManR activity. Second, in the absence of glucose/mannose, phosphorylated EIIBMpo (P{$\sim$}EIIBMpo) inhibits ManR activity by phosphorylating His871 in PRD2. The presence of glucose/mannose causes the dephosphorylation of P{$\sim$}EIIBMpo and P{$\sim$}PRD2 of ManR, which together lead to the induction of the manLMN operon. Complementation of a {$\Delta$}manR mutant with various manR alleles confirmed the antagonistic effects of PTS-catalyzed phosphorylation at the two different histidine residues of ManR. Deletion of manR prevented not only the expression of the manLMN operon but also glucose-mediated repression of virulence gene expression; however, repression by other carbohydrates was unaffected. Interestingly, the expression of manLMN in Listeria innocua was reported to require not only ManR but also the Crp-like transcription activator Lin0142. Unlike Lin0142, the L. monocytogenes homologue, Lmo0095, is not required for manLMN expression; its absence rather stimulates man expression. IMPORTANCE Listeria monocytogenes is a human pathogen causing the foodborne disease listeriosis. The expression of most virulence genes is controlled by the transcription activator PrfA. Its activity is strongly repressed by carbohydrates, including glucose, which is transported into L. monocytogenes mainly via a mannose/glucose-specific phosphotransferase system (PTSMan). Expression of the man operon is regulated by the transcription activator ManR, the activity of which is controlled by a second, low-efficiency PTS of the mannose family, which functions as glucose sensor.

  abstract = {Listeria monocytogenes is a facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen that can infect the placenta, a chimeric organ made of maternal and fetal cells. Extravillous trophoblasts (EVT) are specialized fetal cells that invade the uterine implantation site, where they come into direct contact with maternal cells. We have shown previously that EVT are the preferred site of initial placental infection. In this report, we infected primary human EVT with L. monocytogenes. EVT eliminated ,80\% of intracellular bacteria over 24-hours. Bacteria were unable to escape into the cytoplasm and remained confined to vacuolar compartments that became acidified and co-localized with LAMP1, consistent with bacterial degradation in lysosomes. In human placental organ cultures bacterial vacuolar escape rates differed between specific trophoblast subpopulations. The most invasive EVT\textemdash those that would be in direct contact with maternal cells in vivo\textemdash had lower escape rates than trophoblasts that were surrounded by fetal cells and tissues. Our results suggest that EVT present a bottleneck in the spread of L. monocytogenes from mother to fetus by inhibiting vacuolar escape, and thus intracellular bacterial growth. However, if L. monocytogenes is able to spread beyond EVT it can find a more hospitable environment. Our results elucidate a novel aspect of the maternal-fetal barrier.},

  abstract = {Listeriolysin O (LLO) is a pore-forming toxin that mediates phagosomal escape and cell-to-cell spread of the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. In order to identify factors that control the production, activity, or secretion of this essential virulence factor, we constructed a Himar1 mariner transposon delivery system and screened 50,000 mutants for a hypohemolytic phenotype on blood agar plates. Approximately 200 hypohemolytic mutants were identified, and the 51 most prominent mutants were screened ex vivo for intracellular growth defects. Eight mutants with a phenotype were identified, and they contained insertions in the following genes: lmo0964 (similar to yjbH), lmo1268 (clpX), lmo1401 (similar to ymdB), lmo1575 (similar to ytqI), lmo1695 (mprF), lmo1821 (similar to prpC), lmo2219 (prsA2), and lmo2460 (similar to cggR). Some of these genes are involved in previously unexplored areas of research with L. monocytogenes: the genes yjbH and clpX regulate the disulfide stress response in Bacillus subtilis, and the prpC phosphatase has been implicated in virulence in other gram-positive pathogens. Here we demonstrate that prsA2, an extracytoplasmic peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase, is critical for virulence and contributes to the folding of LLO and to the activity of another virulence factor, the broad-range phospholipase C (PC-PLC). Furthermore, although it has been shown that prsA2 expression is linked to PrfA, the master virulence transcription factor in L. monocytogenes pathogenesis, we demonstrate that prsA2 is not directly controlled by PrfA. Finally, we show that PrsA2 is involved in flagellum-based motility, indicating that this factor likely serves a broad physiological role.},

In contrast to necrosis, apoptosis is a regulated, energy-dependent form of cell death leading to phagocytosis of cellular remnants by neighboring cells. Characteristic morphological features of these two forms of cell death will be discussed and correlated to underlying molecular mechanisms.},
